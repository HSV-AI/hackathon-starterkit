      "Day 2 of the Supreme Court confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett took place before the Senate on October 13. Barrett answered questions about Roe v. Wade, the Affordable Care Act, gun regulation, and more. Read the transcript of the full hearing with Barrett’s testimony here.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "01:43\n",
      ")\n",
      "[crosstalk 00:01:43] … 30 minute period today, then come back Wednesday and finish up. Then we’ll go on about our business. \n",
      "So\n",
      " I will try, I’ll make sure I stay within 30 minutes for sure, and if I can shorten it up, I will. \n",
      "So\n",
      " let’s get to it. You can start the clock. \n",
      "So\n",
      " you can relax a bit here, judge, and take your mask off. So yesterday we had a lot of the discussion about the Affordable Health Care Act. What I’m going to try to do very briefly this morning is to demonstrate the difference between politics and judging. \n",
      "All of\n",
      " my colleagues on the other side had very emotional pleas about Obamacare, charts of people with pre-existing conditions. I want to give you my side of the story about Obamacare.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "02:31\n",
      ")\n",
      "Now, this is Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina talking. This is not a question directed at you. From my point of view, Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina. All of you over there want to impose Obamacare on South Carolina. We don’t want it. We want something better. We want something different. You know what we want in South Carolina? South Carolina care, not Obamacare. Now, why do we want that? Under the Affordable Care Act, three states get 35% of the money, folks. Can you name them? I’ll help you. California, New York, and Massachusetts. They are 22% of the population. Senator Feinstein’s from California, Nancy Pelosi’s from California. Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Senate is from New York, and Massachusetts is Elizabeth Warren. Now, why do they get 35% of the money when they are only 22% of the population? That’s the way they designed the law. The more you spend, the more you get.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "03:37\n",
      ")\n",
      "What does it mean for the people of South Carolina? If you had a per patient formula, where you got the same amount from the federal government to the state whether you lived in Charleston, Columbia, or San Francisco or New York City, if you leveled that out, it’d be almost a billion dollars more for us in South Carolina. \n",
      "So\n",
      " to my friends over there, we’re going to fight back. We want our money. If you’re going to have money allocated for Obamacare, we’re not going to sit back and quietly let you give 35% of it to three states. What else has happened in South Carolina? Four rural hospitals have closed because the revenue streams are uncertain. 30% increase in premiums in South Carolina for those on \n",
      "Obamacare. I was on Obamacare for a few years before I got on track here. My premiums went up 300%. My coverage was almost non-existent. A $6,000 deductible.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "04:40\n",
      ")\n",
      "So I want a better deal, and that’s a political fight. I’m in a campaign at home. If it were up to me, we would block grant this money, send it back to the states in a \n",
      "more fair\n",
      " allocation, and we would require pre-existing conditions to be covered as part of the block grant. We want sick people covered. But I got an idea. I think South Carolina may be able to deal with diabetes better and different than California. If you want good outcomes in medicine you need innovation, and the best way to get innovation is to allow people to try different things to get better outcomes. \n",
      "So\n",
      " the debate on healthcare is consolidating all the power in Washington, have some bureaucrat you’ll never meet running this program versus having it centered in the state where you live. Under my proposal, South Carolina would get almost a billion dollars more. The state of South Carolina would \n",
      "be in charge of\n",
      " administering Obamacare. They couldn’t build football stadiums with the money. They \n",
      "have to\n",
      " spend it on healthcare. They’d have to cover pre-existing conditions.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "05:47\n",
      ")\n",
      "But, as a patient in South Carolina, you would have a voice you don’t have today. If you didn’t like what was happening to you on the healthcare front, you could go to local officials and complain, and the people you’re complaining to live in your state. They send their family to the same hospital as you go. That’s a structural difference. That’s got nothing to do with this hearing. It’s got everything to do with politics. We on this side, do not. And the difference between analyzing a lawsuit and having a political argument is fundamentally different, and I hope to be able to demonstrate that over the course of the day. And I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle will not feel shy about telling my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why we think we have a better idea on healthcare. Now, the bottom line here, judge, you said yesterday something that struck \n",
      "me\n",
      " and I want the American people to understand what you meant.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "06:45\n",
      ")\n",
      "You said you’re an originalist. Is that true?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "06:47\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "06:48\n",
      ")\n",
      "What does that mean, in English? Pass the button. I mean, we all love Senator Lee, but in English.\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "07:00\n",
      ")\n",
      "In English. Okay. \n",
      "So\n",
      " in English that means that I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time \n",
      "people ratified it. So that meaning doesn’t change over time and it’s not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "07:22\n",
      ")\n",
      "So in other words, you’re bound by the people who wrote it at the time they wrote it. That keeps you from substituting your judgment for theirs. Is that correct?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "07:29\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "07:30\n",
      ")\n",
      "All right. Justice Scalia. He was an originalist, right?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "07:34\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes, he was.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "07:34\n",
      ")\n",
      "People say that you’re a female Scalia. What would you say?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "07:38\n",
      ")\n",
      "I would say that justice Scalia was obviously a mentor, and as I said when I accepted the President’s nomination, that his philosophy is mine too. He was a very eloquent defender of originalism, \n",
      "And\n",
      " that was also true of textualism, which is the way that I approach statutes and their interpretation. And \n",
      "similarly\n",
      " to what I just said about originalism, for textualism, the judge approaches the text as it was written with the meaning it had at the time and doesn’t infuse our own meaning into it. But I want to be careful to say that if I’m confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett. And that’s so because originalists don’t always agree and neither do textualist. Justices Scalia and Thomas disagreed often enough that my friend, Judge Melissa Parr, teaches a class called Scalia Versus Thomas. It’s not a mechanical exercise.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "08:38\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, I’ll wait till the movie comes out. \n",
      "So\n",
      " the bottom line for me is there’s a narrative building in this country, and again, you can stand down, this is just me speaking for me. Justice Ginsburg was an iconic figure in American history, just not the law. She was a trailblazer. She fought for better conditions for women throughout society. She was unashamedly progressive in her personal thought. She was devout to her faith. She worked for the ACLU. She was proudly pro-choice personally. But all of us on this side, apparently when they voted, accepted that she was highly qualified. What I want the American people to know. I think it’s okay to be religiously conservative, I think is okay to be personally pro-choice, I think is okay to live your life in a traditional Catholic fashion, and you’d still be qualified for the Supreme Court. \n",
      "So\n",
      " all the young conservative women out there, this hearing to me is about a place for you.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "09:40\n",
      ")\n",
      "I hope when this is all over that there’ll be a place for you at the table. There’ll be a spot for you at the Supreme Court like there was for judge Ginsburg. And to President Trump, I don’t know if you’re listening or not, by picking Judge Barrett you have publicly said you find value in \n",
      "all of\n",
      " these characteristics. But beyond anything else you find Judge Barrett to be highly qualified. I would say you’re one of the greatest picks President Trump could have made, and from the conservative side of the aisle, you’re one of the most qualified people of your generation. Let’s talk about Brown vs. Board of Education, because I know Senator Blumenthal will. I’m going to talk about that. You said in writings, it was a super precedent. What did you mean?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "10:28\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, in my writings, so as a professor, I talked about the doctrine of Stare Decisis, and super precedent is not a doctrinal term that comes from the Supreme Court and I think maybe in political conversation or in newspapers, people use it different ways. But in my writing, I was using a framework that’s been articulated by other scholars. And in that context, super precedent means precedent that is so well established that it would be unthinkable that it would ever be overruled. And there are about six cases on this list that other scholars have identified.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "11:03\n",
      ")\n",
      "Let’s talk about Brown and talk about why it would be unthinkable. First, let’s talk about, what’s the process that would lead to it being overruled? What would have to happen?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "11:15\n",
      ")\n",
      "For Brown to be overruled, you would have to have Congress or some state or local government impose segregation again, [crosstalk 00:11:25].\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "11:25\n",
      ")\n",
      "Okay, let’s stop right there. If you want to make yourself famous, by the end of the day, you can say, “We want to go back to segregation,” I promise you, you’ll be on every cable TV channel in America. I doubt if you’ll go very far, but the point we’re trying to make here is the court just can’t wake up and say, “Let’s revisit Brown.” It \n",
      "has to\n",
      " be a case in controversy, is that right?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "11:46\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes, that’s right.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "11:47\n",
      ")\n",
      "So before a Brown decision, you could review Brown, somebody out there would have to be dumb enough to pass a law saying, “Let’s go back to segregated schools.” Is that fair to say?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "11:57\n",
      ")\n",
      "That is fair to say.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",

      "I do not see that happening anytime soon.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "12:02\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yeah, I don’t either. \n",
      "So\n",
      " let’s talk about the process in general. There’s the Heller case. What’s that about?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "12:09\n",
      ")\n",
      "The Heller case is a case decided by the Supreme court, which held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "12:18\n",
      ")\n",
      "Okay. Now, my friends on the left, some of them have a problem with Heller. They may try to challenge the construct of Heller. If a state or local government passed a law in defiance of Heller, what would happen?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "12:30\n",
      ")\n",
      "In defiance of Heller?\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",

      "Or that was challenging the construct of Heller?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "12:34\n",
      ")\n",
      "That challenge, the construct of Heller, if it was brought in a lower court, Heller binds. I mean, lower courts always \n",
      "have to\n",
      " follow a Supreme Court precedent.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "12:44\n",
      ")\n",
      "And if the Supreme Court wanted to revisit Heller, what would they do?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "12:50\n",
      ")\n",
      "If someone challenged Heller below, because a state or local government passed a law contradicting Heller, the Supreme Court would have to take that case once it was appealed all the way up. \n",
      "So\n",
      " the Court would have to decide, “Yes, we want to overrule Heller and we have enough votes to grant cert,” and then do so.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "13:07\n",
      ")\n",
      "So that’s the way the process works?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "13:09\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes, it would start because there was a law. Then there was a lawsuit. Then there was an appeal. And then the court granted cert, and then the court decided the case.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "13:17\n",
      ")\n",
      "Is that true no matter what the issue is? Whether it’s gun, abortion, healthcare, campaign finance, does that process hold true for everything?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "13:26\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes. Judges can’t just wake up one day and say\n",
      ", ”\n",
      " I have an agenda. I like guns. I hate guns. I like abortion. I hate abortion,” and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world. You \n",
      "have to\n",
      " wait for cases and controversies, which is the language of the Constitution, to wind their way through the process.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "13:46\n",
      ")\n",
      "All right. Well, Senator \n",
      "Sasse\n",
      " gave us a good civics lesson. I hope that’s the basic lesson in law here. \n",
      "So\n",
      " if a state said, “I don’t think you should have over six bullets,” and somebody believed that violated the Second Amendment, there would be a lawsuit and the same process would work, right?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "14:03\n",
      ")\n",
      "The same process would work. In that case, there would be parties would have to sue the state arguing that, that law was unconstitutional. It would wind its way up, and if it got to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court decided to take it, a whole \n",
      "decision making\n",
      " process begins. You hear arguments from litigants on both sides. They write briefs. You talk to clerks as a judge. You talk to your colleagues. Then you write an opinion. Opinions circulate, and you get feedback from your colleagues. \n",
      "So\n",
      " it’s an entire process. It’s not something that a judge or justice would wake up and say, “Oh, we’re hearing this case. I know what my vote is going to be.”\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "14:46\n",
      ")\n",
      "Let’s talk about the two Supreme Court cases regarding abortion. What are the two leading cases in America regarding abortion?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "14:54\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, I think most people think of Roe vs. Wade, and Casey is the case after Roe that preserved Roe’s central holding, but grounded it …\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "15:03\n",
      ")\n",
      "Roe that preserved Roe’s central holding, but grounded it in a slightly different rationale.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "15:05\n",
      ")\n",
      "So what is that rationale?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "15:07\n",
      ")\n",
      "Rationale is that the state cannot impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "15:14\n",
      ")\n",
      "Okay. Unlike Brown, there are states challenging on the abortion front. There are states that are going to a fetal heartbeat bill. I have a bill, judge, that would disallow abortion on demand at the 20 weeks, the fifth month of the pregnancy. We’re one of seven nations in the entire world that allow abortion on demand at the fifth month. The construct or my bill is, because the child is capable of feeling pain in the fifth month. Doctors tell us to save the child’s life, you \n",
      "have to\n",
      " provide anesthesia if you operate because they can feel pain. The argument I’m making is if you \n",
      "have to\n",
      " provide anesthesia to save the child’s life, because they can feel pain, it must be a terrible death to be dismembered by an abortion. That’s a theory to protect the unborn at the fifth month. If that litigation comes before you, will you listen to both sides?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "16:12\n",
      ")\n",
      "Of course. I’ll do that in every case.\n",
      "Chairman Lindsey Graham: (\n",
      "16:13\n",
      ")\n",
      "So I think 14 states have already passed a version of what I’ve just described. So there really is a debate in America still, unlike Brown versus Board of Education, about the rights of the unborn. That’s just one example. \n",
      "So\n",
      " if there’s a challenge coming from a state, if a state passes a law, and it goes into court where people say, “This violates Casey,” how do you decide that?\n",
      "Amy Coney Barrett: (\n",
      "16:41\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, it would begin in a district court, in a trial court. The trial court would make a record. The parties would litigate and fully develop that record in the trial court. Then it would go up to a court of appeals that would review that record, looking for error. And then, again, it would be the same process. Someone would have to seek certiorari at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court would have to grant it. And then at that point, it would be the full judicial process. It would be briefs, oral argument, conversations with law clerks in chambers, consultation with colleagues, writing an opinion, really digging down into it. It’s not just a vote. You all do that. You all have a policy, and you cast a vote. The judicial process is different.\n",

To my good friend, Senator Whitehouse, me and you are going to come closer and closer about regulating money. Because I don’t know what’s going on out there, but I can tell you there’s a lot of money being raised in this campaign. I’d like to know where the hell some of it’s coming from.

      "Well, it would. And one thing I’ve neglected to say before that’s occurring to me now, is that not only would someone have to challenge that statute. If they outlawed same-sex marriage, there’d have to be a case challenging it. And for the Supreme Court to take it up, you’d have to have lower courts going along and saying, “We’re going to flout Obergefell.” And the most likely result would be that lower courts, who are bound by Obergefell, would shut such a lawsuit down. And it wouldn’t make its way up to the Supreme Court. But if it did, it would be the same process I’ve described.\n",

      "21:45\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, let’s just say that you’re in the camp, or anybody’s in the camp, that substantive due process, as a legal concept, is unbounded. It basically makes the Constitution no more certain than the five people interpreting it at any given time in the country. Whatever rights they think you have, you get. Whatever rights they want to take away from you, they can. It’s a pretty nebulous legal concept. That’s sort of my view of it. I’m not imposing my views on yours. But then there’s a thing called precedent. Let’s say you didn’t like a case decided under substantive due process, you thought the whole concept was Constitutionally an era. How does precedent play?\n",

      "So precedent is the principle that cases that have been decided by the Court, before this one lands on the docket, are presumptively controlling.

So precedent is a principle that you’re not going to overrule something without good reason, or royal up the law, without justification for doing so.\n",

      ", deeply concerning. During her confirmation hearing, before this committee, in 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked several questions about her views on whether the Constitution protects a woman’s right to abortion. She unequivocally confirmed her view that the Constitution protects a woman’s right to abortion. She explained it like this, and I quote, \n",

I was President of the Board of Supervisors, they worked with me to pass a city-wide ordinance in 1978, that provided critical protection against discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. At that time, this was one of the strongest protections for the gay community in the entire nation. We’ve come a long way since then, and I think we should never go back. In June of 2008, 58 years after they met, my two friends were finally able to marry, when the California Supreme Court ruled that same sex couples cannot be denied the fundamental right to marry. Del died two months later. Because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, Phyllis was denied social security survivor benefits, even though her spouse had paid into this basic safety net for her entire working life. \n",
      "Phyl\n",
      " had to rely on the help of friends and fellow activists. In 2013, as you probably know, because you know so much about this, US v. Windsor, the Supreme Court struck DOMA down. Two years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court recognized that the fundamental right to marry could not be denied to LGBT Americans. Both decisions were decided by a five to four margin.

So I don’t think that anybody should assume that just because justice Scalia decided a decision a certain way, that I would too, but I’m not going to express a view on whether I agree or disagree with Justice Scalia, for the same reasons that I’ve been giving. Justice Ginsburg with her characteristic pithiness used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing: “No hints, no previews, no forecasts.” That had been the practice of nominees before her, but everybody calls it the Ginsburg Rule because she stated it so concisely, and it’s been the practice of every nominee since. \n",

These opponents said that Republicans just want to confirm you so that you, “will carry their policies forward.” Meaning Republican policies forward on the Supreme Court. But this only shows Democrats fundamentally misunderstand what judges are supposed to do. A judge is supposed to interpret laws in an impartial manner, consistent with the Constitution.

Lawmaking’s our job, if people are all like what we do, they can vote us out of office. Some other points on the Affordable Care Act, the Democrats continue to misrepresent or claim to know Barrett’s view on affordable care and access to healthcare.

      "Not only is Judge Barrett a mother of seven, she had children with pre-existing medical challenges of her own. No one on this committee or anyone has any right to suggest that she doesn’t care about access to healthcare or protection for the vulnerable. Now, getting back to the technical concerns about Robert’s Affordable Care Act opinion. First, and I got four points along this line, her comments dealt with Robert’s statutory interpretation of just one provision of the law. That provision is no longer even in effect. In 2017, Congress zeroed out the so-called tax, the tax connected with the individual mandate. The question before the court this fall are entirely separate. She never ruled on the Affordable Care Act, nor commented on how she’d vote. Meaning the Judge, how she would vote. \n",

      "Now second point. Lawyers and legal academics often consider a court reasoning even when they have no disagreement with the outcome of the case. For instance, the New York Times recently reported, Ginsburg, before joining the Supreme Court, “Wasn’t really fond of Roe v. Wade. She didn’t like how it was structured.” I don’t blame or don’t know why Democrats have a different standard for you, Judge Barrett. Now a third point. It’s blatantly inconsistent for the left to use this line of attack. We all know that President Obama said that the ACA legislative mandate was not a tax. Even liberal Jeffrey \n",
      "Toobin\n",
      " said Robert’s argument was, “Not a persuasive one.” \n",
      "So\n",
      " Judge Barrett’s analysis of Robert’s legal reasoning is well inside the mainstream. Now a fourth point, more inconsistency. The same Democrats vilify Judge Barrett as a threat to those with pre-existing conditions.\n",

The truth is Judge Barrett already said, “A judge must apply the law as written.” She further commented, “To decide cases according to the rule of law, beginning to end.” That’s what we should all look for judges to do. Now for my first question, when Justice Scalia came to my office before his confirmation, and I think I brought this up with every nominee to the Supreme Court by Republican or Democrat nominees.

Justice Scalia as was well-known railed against the use of legislative history.

      ", I don’t look to legislative history when I’m deciding cases. I wouldn’t say that it would never be relevant. Even Justice Scalia himself said that there could be instances. For example, if you were trying to determine whether a term used in a statute, how it was used, if it had a technical meaning, or how it was understood, that that might be an appropriate time to consult legislative history. Or Justice Scalia himself consulted it when he was trying to determine whether there had been an error in the way the statute was drafted.

      ", which involved the interpretation of Section 403 of the First Step Act, which I had a big part along with Senator Lee and Senator Durbin in getting that passed in 2018. This is the most significant criminal justice legislation in a generation, our criminal justice system can’t just punish and deter. It must also rehabilitate and promote successful re-entry into society. The First Step Act accomplished these goals through prison and sentencing reform. It was well-known that the goal of the First Step Act was to make smart and cost-effective changes to the criminal code and to reduce a risk of recidivism. \n",
      "So\n",
      " I want to ask you about your dissent in this case, the issue was whether the sentencing reform provision of the First Step Act applied to a defendant whose sentence had been vacated.

      " we had a dispute about what the plain text of the statute required.

Both the majority and your dissent in the case reviewed 403 of the Act under a plain reading of the text. As an author and leader in this law’s passage, I’d like to discuss how a plain reading of the statute could lead to varying outcomes. The section in question contemplates, when a sentence has been imposed on a defendant, according to the text’s statute and relevant case law, a defendant sentence, if vacated creates a clean slate. That means defendant is placed in the same position as if he had never been sentenced. But your dissent comes to the opposite conclusion on whether a sentence has been imposed. Note, that I agree with you that the laws need to be read and interpreted literally. \n",

      "Well, that language that it did not apply to defendants on whom sentences had already been imposed, my dissenting colleagues and I said, well, the language is sentences. It doesn’t say invalid sentences. And one could certainly say, if asked if someone had been sentenced, yes, he was sentenced, but that sentence was later vacated. And you’re right \n",
      "that the majority relied heavily on this clean slate principle. But in my review of the law, this clean slate principle wasn’t \n",
      "really present\n",
      " because the sentencing reform act for example, instructs district courts applying the guidelines at sentencing to ply those that were in effect on the date of the original sentencing. \n",
      "So\n",
      " I thought that the clean slate principle, they were pushing a little too hard on it. And there’s certainly unfairness, the First Step Act, \n",
      "it’s\n",

      "Certainly\n",
      " I acknowledge that the legislative branch can be more careful about drafting laws. But I also think that judges should pay attention to congressional intent as set forth in history, when there might be a dispute about how to interpret the statute.

      "Obviously, we all know that that’s the Ginsburg standard. The underlying reason for this rule is that making promises or giving hints on how a judge would rule in a case undermines the very independence of our system. But you’re going to be asked about your personal views as you just have been on various topics, and how you might correctly decide. Of course, the judicial nominee should never promise their future votes on the bench in exchange for the president’s nomination or a senator’s support, you’d be showing the opposite of independence. So my question, so I ask you, do you agree with the Ginsburg standard that it goes to the question of judicial branches independence for legislative history, and all you got to do is say yes, because I’ve heard you talk about it.\n",

One reason you asked that question, I think as a committee, is that you want to know that no nominee has made any pre-commitments.

I expressed no view about what the Constitutional limits of that might be or whether the law should change with respect to felling voting rights. And obviously, that’s a contested issue in some states that are considering it right now. And I have no view on that, and it wasn’t the subject of Kanter.\n",

Or to give another example, to interpret what that law means. But it most certainly is not the imposition of policy preferences. A judge who approaches a case as an opportunity for an exercise of will, has acted, has betrayed her judicial duty.\n",

      "Of course. There are strong reasons, I believe, why over the last more than a century and a half, we’ve left that number at nine. As you point out there’s nothing in the Constitution that requires it. We could come up with any number we wanted. There does have to be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as we choose to create, but it doesn’t specify the number of seats that can be on there. There are nonetheless good prudential reasons, reasons having to do with respect for the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Reasons that have, over the last 150 plus years, left us to leave that number at nine.\n",
      "Senator Lee: (\n",
      "01:51:42\n",
      ")\n",
      "The last time, as far as I can tell, there was any serious effort to move the number above nine, it was in the fall of 1936 when president Franklin D. Roosevelt got tired of the so-called four horsemen of the apocalypse, a few members of the Supreme Court who were consistently voting against his agenda, and sometimes joined by one or more other members of the Supreme Court. He got particularly tired of this, and so he proposed packing the court. And let me explain what I mean by packing the court here. What I mean when I refer to this is increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and doing so by statute with the intent of altering the composition of the court for short-term political gain. That’s what FDR wanted to do.\n",

      "01:52:32\n",

      "Not withstanding\n",
      " the fact that he had an overwhelming super majority in both houses of Congress, fortunately, FDR’s idea that he pushed in the fall of 1936 didn’t make it anywhere. It didn’t gain progress. It met enough opposition, even with both houses of Congress being overwhelmingly controlled by his political party, that it stalled, quite mercifully, and it’s remained ever since then at nine justices. I think it would have been a colossal mistake. Joe Biden, himself as a US Senator, as a member of this body, in a proceeding of this committee in 1983 gave a rousing speech that I recommend to all talking about that very thing. Acknowledging that the Constitution doesn’t require it, but \n",
      "our respect for the separation of powers really ought to lead to us sticking to the number nine. Don’t pack the court.\n",
      "Senator Lee: (\n",
      "01:53:27\n",
      ")\n",
      "In recent days, I’ve seen some in the media and some in this body try to redefine what it means to pack the court. Some have suggested, well, court packing takes various forms, and it can mean confirming a lot of people all at once. Some have defined it so as to suggest that it consists of doing that which the Trump administration and the Republican Senate have been doing over the last three and a half years, which is filling vacancies as they have arisen and doing so with textualist, originalist judges. This may not be something that some like, but this is not court packing. Court packing is itself manipulative. It’s something that has great danger to do immense political and Constitutional harm to our system of government. In part, because it would set up a one-way ratchet. Once you create a position and confirm someone to that position, absent death, retirement, or impeachment and removal, that position remains in place.\n",
      "Senator Lee: (\n",
      "01:54:28\n",
      ")\n",
      "So if, for example, a future Congress and White House were to decide to get together and to pack the court and increase the number, say to 11. And let’s say it’s Democrats who do that. And we’ve got Joe Biden now as a Presidential candidate who’s refusing to say whether he would do it. There’s a reason he’s not saying whether he would do it. There’s only one reason why you refuse to answer that question, and it’s if you’re wanting to be able to do it, but you don’t want to take the heat for the fact that you’re thinking about doing it right now.\n",
      "Senator Lee: (\n",
      "01:55:08\n",
      ")\n",
      "So if they do that, where does it lead? Well, it inevitably leads to the point where the next time Republicans have control of both houses of Congress and the White House, they’d increase it as well. You’d end up increasing it incrementally. Before long, it looks like the Senate in Star Wars where you’ve got hundreds of people on there. I don’t know what the total number would be, but you increase it at all, you change the number at all, you do so for partisan political purposes at all, you de-legitimize the court. And you can’t de-legitimize the court without fundamentally threatening and eroding and impairing some of our most valued liberties. You can’t do that without inevitably threatening things like religious freedom, things like free speech, things that are themselves often unpopular, but are protected by the Constitution, precisely because they are unpopular.\n",

      "So to all of you, we’ve heard a lot this morning from the Senators, a little less from Judge Barrett about her views, but I want to come to you first, Marcia Coyle. We did hear a little from her that we know that her family owns a gun. We know that she and her family teared up when they watched the video of the death of George Floyd this summer. But when it comes to answering questions about how she would rule, what she would decide, how does that compare to what we’ve seen from other justices nominated in recent years?\n",
      "Marcia Coyle: (\n",
      "01:59:29\n",

      "Well, Judy, I think it’s pretty clear that all nominees have learned sort of the magic words to say when they are asked about specific rulings by the Supreme Court, how they may rule on other issues, they’re just not going to make any kind of commitment or any statement that might reveal how they think about those particular issues. And \n",
      "so\n",
      " we didn’t really learn a whole lot from Judge Barrett about issues that are common discussions and debates at dinner tables in America. I think that the hearing this morning really stayed focused on each side’s goals here. You saw that the Democrats who were singularly focused yesterday on the Affordable Care Act followed up on that. I’d say the Affordable Care Act, abortion, and guns were the topics they were most interested in, and that was because they have a little more meat to deal with. They have some of Judge Barrett’s opinions on the Seventh Circuit, as well as writing and speeches. \n",
      "So\n",
      " they did try to learn more about her through those, but I think they scored limited points.\n",
      "Judy Woodruff : (\n",
      "02:00:51\n",
      ")\n",
      "Democrats, I was going to say, Democrats certainly did come back at those questions time and again. John Yang, on several occasions, we heard Judge Barrett say, and it came out at the very beginning when Lindsey Graham, the Chair, asked her to compare herself to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, because she has called him her mentor. He asked her, would you be another Judge Scalia? And she made a point of saying she’d be different.\n",
      "John Yang: (\n",
      "02:01:27\n",
      ")\n",
      "She said she’d be Justice Barrett. I think it’s also, to sort of add on to what Marcia was saying, we learned, or she spoke more about her judicial philosophy. But I think that was clear from her previous writings that she’s an originalist, she goes back to what the words meant when the Constitution was ratified or when the amendments were ratified. And she is a textualist, she goes after the words on the paper. She doesn’t care, not doesn’t care, but she does not give precedence to legislative intent, what the lawmakers said when they pass laws.\n",
      "John Yang: (\n",
      "02:02:03\n",
      ")\n",
      "But I don’t know that that is necessarily a predictor of how she would rule, as was pointed out before, yesterday. The current, one of the leading originalists and textualists on the court now, is Neil Gorsuch. And he ruled earlier this year that Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination against gay men, lesbian women, and transgender Americans. That was hotly contested by two other originalists, contextualist, Justices Alito and Thomas, who said in their dissent that this was not a textual exercise, that all Gorsuch had done was rewrite Title Seven to meet the current standards. \n",
      "So\n",
      " it’s really not a predictor at all. As she says, originalists and textualists can disagree, and they do.\n",

      "Act, also known as Obamacare, that the case coming before the court in November is based on a different question from the case that was decided several years ago, in which the Chief Justice ruled one way in a way that she was critical of. She went out of her way, it seemed to me, to say, “I don’t want you to think that I’ve telegraphed anything by what I’ve said before about the Chief.”\n",

      ": (\n",
      "02:03:49\n",
      ")\n",
      "Well, I think she did go out of her way because it is somewhat unusual for a Justice who had been so pointed about criticizing a Chief in their writings. But I think what you really need to know about this methodology here, which is behind this is it can predict something. And it predicted that cases such as King v. Burwell, which was the first one up there on text, or this current case would never have gone up there when I was a law student, because textualism didn’t exist. Textualism allows a judge to pick and choose texts. They don’t think that, but that’s what happens. And these cases would have been considered, “Well, I defer to the legislature.” \n",
      "So\n",
      " there is something more I think you can predict. Yes, they come out with different results sometimes, but that’s because the method isn’t determinative in any way.\n",

      "So they believe that it restrains. But in fact, the data shows that it doesn’t constrain. And you know, I think one of the ways you can see this is if you look at the gun decision that Senator Durbin was talking about, because she’s to the right of Scalia on that. He said that gun felon laws in Heller were fine. Now she said that was dicta. But in that case, she basically claimed, “Oh, I’m not going to decide anything about the consequences of this. And I’m going to rewrite the statute.” She rewrote the statute, as Durbin said, to add violent felony. Wisconsin wrote a statute that said felony, period. Why doesn’t it say all felonies? Well, she says, “No, it doesn’t because of the Constitution.” \n",
      "So\n",

And that’s not a fault of the theory, it’s the fault of imprecision in language. And I say this as someone \n",

They held this for reporters to talk about their strategy today going into questions. And the strategy that Democrats said they were going to pursue, at least what Senator Blumenthal said, is they wanted to show that Amy Coney Barrett’s ideas are radical and extreme.

He’s still a couple hours ahead. I think about three hours ahead in the hearing. But I think if they’re trying to make the case that Judge Barrett is way out of step with judicial norms, they haven’t gone that far. They seem to have instead done more to say that she could affect people’s lives. That’s a political message that also has to do with the election. Now, on the other hand, Republicans have their own strategy. As Democrats want to show Judge Barrett as being extreme, Republicans are trying to make the case that it’s Democrats who are extreme, that they are willing to do anything to push out a nominee who they see as credible. And that also of course has to do with the election and trying to convince voters which side is more reasonable and better for the future of this country.\n",

Burwell, the second case. And that is correct. It’s not the same issue, but I think the point that the Democrats were trying to make is that the stakes are very much the same.

The implication is unmistakable. Under our Constitutional structure, Congress holds the lead reign in making the right to vote equally real for all U.S. citizens.” Do you agree with Justice Ginsburg’s conclusion that the Constitution clearly empowers Congress to protect the right to vote?\n",

We’re talking about the entire foundation of our democracy here. For centuries, Americans have fought and died to protect the right to vote, and so what matters is not just what you say about its being fundamental, it’s what you do.

And she said, “The majority opinion boggled the mind.” \n",
      "So\n",
      " what boggles my mind? Well, two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the South Carolina report requirement that mail in ballots must have witness signatures, in the middle of a pandemic. You’ve got to go and get a witness.\n",

And the Governor right now is forcing that state to have only one ballot box per county, including in Harris County where there are 4.7 million people. And for those of you that thought a judge took care of it a few days ago, he did. But then yesterday three Trump appointed judges came in and reversed that, so we’re back to one ballot box for people to drop their ballots off in a county of 4.7 million people. In Tennessee, Republicans have tried to prevent ballot drop boxes. I know, we had the Secretary of State as one of our witnesses at a rules committee hearing, and they have argued in court that COVID-19 is a valid excuse to vote by mail. In North Carolina, the Supreme Court struck down a core component of the Voting Rights Act. What happened? Well, states like North Carolina passed laws that were so egregious to make it harder to vote that the Fourth Circuit struck down their law and noted that it targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision. So that is what the states saw, and that is why \n",

This is Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina talking. This is not a question directed at you. From my point of view, Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina. All of you over there that want to impose Obamacare on South Carolina, we don’t want it. We want something \n",

Senator Feinstein’s from California, Nancy Pelosi’s from California, Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Senate is from New York, and Massachusetts is Elizabeth Warren. Now, why do they get 35% of the money when they’re only 22% of the population? That’s the way they designed the law, the more you spend the more you get. What does it mean for the people of South Carolina? If you had a per patient formula where you got the same amount from the federal government to the state, whether you lived in Charleston, Columbia, or San Francisco or New York City, if you leveled that out it’d be almost $1 billion dollars more for us in South Carolina. \n",

What else has happened in South Carolina? Four rural hospitals have closed because the revenue streams are uncertain. 30% increase in premiums in South Carolina for those on Obamacare. I was on Obamacare for a few years before I got on track here. My premiums went up 300%. My coverage was almost non-existent. A $6,000 deductible. \n",

We, on this side, do not believe Obamacare is the best way to provide quality healthcare over time. Our friends on the other side, this is a placeholder for single payer healthcare. If you don’t believe me, just ask them. So that’s the fight going into 2020. Doesn’t make them bad, it just makes them different.

And I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle will not feel shy about telling my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why we think we have a better idea on healthcare.

But I want to be careful to say that if I’m confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett, and that’s so because originalists don’t always agree, and neither do textualists. Justices Scalia and Thomas disagreed often enough that my friend Judge Ann Melissa Parr teaches a class called Scalia versus Thomas. It’s not a mechanical exercise.\n",

And somebody … so if they outlawed same-sex marriage, there’d have to be a case challenging it. And for the Supreme Court to take it up, you’d have to have lower courts going along and saying, “We’re going to flout Obergefell.” And the most likely result would be that lower courts, who are bound by Obergefell, would shut such a lawsuit down and it wouldn’t make its way up to the Supreme Court.

      "Well, let’s just say that you’re in the camp or anybody’s in the camp that substantive due process as a legal concept is unbounded. It basically makes the Constitution no more certain than the five people interpreting it at any given time in the country. Whatever rights they think you have, you get; whatever rights they want to take away from you, they can, is a pretty nebulous legal concept. That’s sort of my view of it and I’m not imposing my views on yours. But then there’s a thing called precedent. Let’s say you didn’t like a case decided under substantive due process, you thought the whole concept was constitutionally in error. How does precedent play?\n",

In the 2013 letter that you signed there is a following statement, \n",

If the courts are going to supplant the judgments of legislators, if judges are going to legislate from the bench, that’s the import of your reasoning in that descent, it may not have dealt precisely with any of these particular laws, but the reasoning throws into doubt, it raises the risk to many of them, and folks who live in Connecticut are terrified of that prospect, at least any who’ve talked to me.\n",

In my highway patrol in North Carolina, 75% fewer applications to go into the troopers Academy and record high request for retirement, we see that in New York, we see it across this country. I think people are afraid because many people, including people on this committee, are unwilling to condemn the acts of violence in public safety out there and condemn violence against law enforcement, which is rampant.

But what we have here in the Affordable Care Act is something that is so flawed that the majority of the Democratic candidates for president all raise their hand and said it needed to be replaced with something they call Medicare for All, which could be Medicare for none. We know the broken promises of, if you like your doctor, you could keep it, if you like your healthcare, you could keep it.

And it sounds like that’s mostly what you’re thinking of. And an agency, when a court reviews whether an agency has exceeded its lawful authority, it goes to the statute that you in Congress enact and interprets that statute, looks at the text, and tries to tell whether you’ve given the agency, given the EPA, in your example, leeway to adopt policies.

In fact, probably one of the most respected person on both sides of the aisle, General Mattis, who served as our Secretary of Defense, went as far as to say, a man who has been very reserved in his comments, that Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy.\n",

And it’s not normal, amidst this all, and again, something that I find hard to believe that we’re talking about is that we have a president who cannot commit himself to the peaceful transfer of power. Now, in the light of this abnormality, most Americans think we should wait on your nomination. It’s an illegitimate process. Most Americans think that we should wait.

The first was one of my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse spent a very long presentation trying to make the case that there is a lot of dark money out there trying to control the Supreme Court nominations and this whole process and the situation that we face today.\n",

      "that we should get it out. What this means is that money that where you don’t know who the real donors are behind the entity that’s making the expenditures. Fortunately, we’re getting a lot of that out, but there’s still a lot there. The impression though that was left was that this dark money is all on one side. The reality is if you look at it, opensecrets.org, this data is from 2016, but I’ve seen that even later into 2018, and it’s the same kind of statistics.\n",

I think we ought to get it out, but let’s not try to create the impression that this is just some one-sided circumstance that’s happening in the country. The other thing I want to go over first before I got into my questions is the same thing I went over yesterday. Because the allegations have been made again and again and again, that somehow we are rushing this case and somehow we are violating the history and the precedent of the way the Senate operates and the way the presidency operates when there is a vacancy in an election year.\n",

      "In every single case, the sitting president made a nomination, every case. In those \n",
      "cases\n",
      " in which the Senate was of the same party as the president, I’m going to use the one for all of the nominations that actually were dealt with in an election year, there were 29. 19 of them were when the party was the same as the president. 17 of those 19, the party moved ahead with the president’s nomination and the nomination was confirmed. 10 of those times, it was when the party was not the party of the president. In nine of those cases, the party that was not the party of the president declined to move forward until the next president was elected. Now that’s the precedent of the Senate. That’s what happened in 2016 when the Senate was of a different party than the president. And it’s what’s \n",

      " when a court decides whether or not to overrule a precedent, it considers first of all, is it wrong? And how egregiously wrong is it? That we can see in the Brown vs Board of Education decision, how that factor played. You also consider reliance interests, because as I said before, stare decisis is short for stand by the thing decided, and don’t disturb the calm. \n",
      "So\n",
      " courts don’t recklessly get in the business of just stirring up, disrupting people’s lives unless it’s the other factors, council, in favor of doing it. You consider whether the law has developed since the precedent in a way that undercuts the foundations of the precedent itself. Same for the facts. You also consider whether the precedent that you set has proved to be workable for the courts below you that must follow it. \n",
      "So\n",
      " in my case, on the seventh circuit, that would mean the district courts have we set out an articulation of the law and a case that lower courts can actually use.\n",

      "And so if I, to paraphrase here, if a judge in a horizontal situation, either a Supreme Court justice evaluating Supreme Court precedent, or a Circuit Court judge evaluating the Circuit Courts precedent, if they felt the precedent was wrong, that’s not enough.\n",

      "02:57:41\n",
      ")\n",
      "That’s true. And this might be a good time, Senator Crapo, for me to make one other point about horizontal stare decisis doctrine. Earlier, and I can’t remember which interchange it was, someone was pointing out, that I said, stare decisis should have weaker effect in constitutional cases. That’s \n",
      "actually what\n",
      " the Supreme Court has said. That’s a well-established principle of stare decisis doctrine itself. The court has said that it gives super strong effect to precedent in statutory cases because you all can always step in and fix any errors of statutory interpretation the court might make. But the court itself has expressly said that it gives weaker stare decisis effect in constitutional cases, because the only way \n",
      "to remedy an error is by constitutional amendment. \n",
      "So\n",
      " I just want to be clear that that is simply a restatement of the court’s own doctrine, that wasn’t something I invented.\n",

      ")\n",
      "Let’s see. I can’t remember how many are on the list, but as I said, it’s in constitutional law scholarship, there are some precedents that scholars have identified as utterly beyond question that no serious person ever calls for their overruling.\n",

      "Marbury versus Madison, which establishes the power of judicial review. Let’s see, the cases… It probably easier for me to just identify what the precedent stand for. So the power of judicial review, the power of the Supreme Court to refute judgments from state courts, the proposition that the 14th amendment applies only to state action, the incorporation of the fourth amendment, and by implication, the other rights in the Bill of Rights against the States. \n",

Now, you also earlier testified that there’s a difference between judicial decision making and the process of making a judicial decision, versus say the process you would as a professor when writing an article or what have you. Could you just quickly get into that with me?\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:01:02\n",
      ")\n",
      "Sure. So a professor when writing law review articles or doing academic critique is kind of at a 10,000 foot level, you’re not in the trenches like a judge is because you are not deciding it in the context of a real case with real litigants in front of you, the adversarial process, where you have people on either side where you hear arguments and you consult with your colleagues and you write your opinion.\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:01:26\n",
      ")\n",
      "And I think one thing that’s worth pointing out about the judicial process is that I have had the experience of changing my mind at various points along the way. I’ve gone into oral argument more than once thinking I was going to rule one way, and then oral arguments changed my mind. Or I’ve gone into conference and my colleagues have changed my mind. I’ve even changed my mind, and this is not uncommon on the court, once I started writing an opinion, judges say it won’t right. Which means what you thought was right when you started writing it, you realize \n",
      "actually didn’t\n",
      " really work out. \n",
      "So\n",
      " I think that process and the fact that judges keep an open mind all the way through is evidence of how the judicial process really is unique in our system, and it is a different enterprise than academic critique.\n",

      "And so I’ve been able to observe that exact process in each of those steps that you talked about taking place and you’re right. That’s how it happens when it’s done properly. Next, I want to go to one more specific process type thing to make sure we all understand it right, and that’s the recusal. Interestingly, you’ve been asked by my colleagues on the other side to assure that you have made no commitments about case law, but that to give a \n",
      "commitment on recusal, you have said that there is a process for recusal as well, and that you would follow that. Could you please lay that out again once again for us?\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:02:58\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes. Recusal is a question of law because 28USC, 455, the recusal statute, \n",
      "actually obligates\n",
      " a judge to recuse in certain cases of either actual bias or apparent bias. And there are Supreme Court precedents interpreting the range of a \n",
      "judges\n",
      " obligations under that statute. There are also professional conduct committees to consult, and I think collaboration and consultation, as I’ve said before, with other justices is the typical practice, according to Justice Ginsburg’s description of it. \n",
      "So\n",
      " it is a legal question that’s governed by statute and precedent. \n",

      "a number of\n",
      " my colleagues here. We’ve heard lot about the Affordable Care Act yesterday and today. I serve on the finance committee as well as the judiciary committee, and so this is an issue I really care about a lot. I’m passionate about ensuring that all individuals, especially Idahoans, have affordable quality healthcare coverage, and making sure that they have coverage for their pre-existing conditions is especially important, regardless of what one thinks about the Obamacare legislation. Reasonable people can disagree about the totality of the success of Obamacare, and this is something that I think should be remembered, but many of the policies in Obamacare were policies that on which we had agreement between Republicans and Democrats, as we moved forward at that time, trying to craft a healthcare law. People may recall this was being negotiated in the finance committee for a quite a while before President Obama pulled it back and then brought his own statute out.\n",
      "Senator Mike Crapo: (\n",
      "03:04:52\n",
      ")\n",
      "And one of the things that we had agreement on was protecting pre-existing conditions back then, there was no fight over that. And in fact, I think every single US Senator wants to protect access to coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions, Republicans and Democrats. So here we are now talking about the Obamacare legislation that was pushed through the Senate when there was a Senate and a president of the same party and the ability to avoid a filibuster. And we’re now looking at legislation challenging one part of that. Again, you’ve talked about this, but I’d like you to just to set up this next question, there’s a difference between NFIB versus Sebelius, the case which you have made some commentary on, and Texas V California. Could you tell me the difference?\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:05:46\n",
      ")\n",
      "Yes. NFIB versus Sebelius involved whether the mandate violated the con… It was framed initially as a case about whether the mandate violated the commerce clause and the majority in that case, as I’ve discussed in earlier interchanges, interpreted the mandate \n",
      "provision to be a tax rather than a penalty. And Chief Justice Roberts said that he thought it was justified as an exercise of Congress’s taxing \n",
      "power, but\n",
      " would have been invalid under the commerce clause.\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:06:17\n",
      ")\n",
      "Now, the new case that the Supreme Court is poised to hear involves a different question. If the mandate, which has now been zeroed out, the initial question does resemble NFIB versus Sebelius because the initial question is, is something a tax if it’s $0? \n",
      "So\n",
      " is it still a tax? And if it’s not a tax, can it be justified under Congress’s taxing power? But severability, even assuming that it is no longer a tax because it’s zeroed out, the next question is if that provision is unconstitutional, does just that provision become inactive, so to speak, or does the whole statute fall? And that is the question of severability. \n",
      "So\n",
      " in some respect, whether one thought that the mandate was unconstitutional or not, the act would have to be found, that would have to be an \n",

      "You may not know the answer to this, but I believe that in the last session of the Supreme Court, the seven members of the court said that there’s a very strong presumption in favor of severability, rather than knocking down an entire status.\n",
      "Amy: (\n",
      "03:07:29\n",

Texas is if, whether now that Congress has just completely zeroed out the mandate, whether it’s still a tax or a penalty, and even if so, is it constitutional, and then even, so is that fatal to the statute? There’s a doctrine called severability, which sounds like legalese, but what it means is, is it okay with the statute?

Worst of all, if you were sick, they could deny you coverage altogether, and there was nothing you could do about it.

Brave activists in the disability community staged sit-ins on the Hill. Seniors protested to keep prescription drugs affordable.

Judge Barrett, you testified yesterday that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg opened the door from any women in law. I certainly believe and know that to be true as a personal matter. She was a trailblazer for women’s equality and gender equity. As a law student, as a teacher, as a civil rights lawyer, and as the second woman ever to sit on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg broke many barriers for women across the country. We, I believe, all fondly remember her as a person who had patience, she had the will and the vision to make our country a more equal place, and a more just place.\n",

The Constitution of the United States protects a woman’s right to choose whether or when to become a parent. And it protects a woman’s right to choose abortion. Women of color, immigrant women, women with low incomes, and women in rural areas, face significant barriers when attempting to access birth control, cancer screenings, and comprehensive reproductive healthcare. Moreover, anti-choice activists and politicians have been working \n",

      "Just last year, the court heard a case that gave it an opportunity to revisit and overturn its abortion precedent. In a case called June Medical Services, the Supreme Court struck down a medically unnecessary restriction that would have closed all but one abortion clinic in Louisiana. Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the court’s four liberal members that the court was bound by its own precedent to strike down the Louisiana law, because it was virtually identical to a Texas law that the court ruled unconstitutional in 2016. As a result, women in the state were able to receive the full range of reproductive care.\n",

After all, President Trump said that overturning Roe V. Wade will quote, “Happen automatically in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.” Judge Barrett, several times today, you have quoted Justice Ginsburg’s testimony about not making predictions in future cases.

It is a decision she must make for herself. When government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.” Then Judge Ginsburg went on to say, quote, “It is essential to women’s equality \n",

But Judge Barrett, your record clearly shows you hold a different view. In 2006, you signed your name to an advertisement published in the South Bend Tribune. It described Roe v. Wade as quote, “an exercise of raw judicial power” and called for putting, quote, “an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.” You signed a similar ad in 2013 that described Roe as quote, “infamous” and expressed opposition to abortion. Also in 2013, you wrote an article about Supreme Court precedent in which you excluded Roe from a list of well settled cases that you said, quote, “No justice would overrule, even if she disagrees,” suggesting of course, that you believe Roe is susceptible to being overturned.\n",

      " they both went back and looked at history. Here’s my question. Since when did justices become historians? Let me put it another way.

      " with the Constitution, sometimes that does require delving into history. One point that I think is worth, Justice Scalia would make this point, that the alternative is, let’s say you have an amendment like the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. If it’s not evident looking at it, whether it’s an individual right, or a collective right, for the sake of the militia, one approach would be to rely on the moral judgment of the justice to say whether they think it’s a good thing or a bad thing for the common good for people to have that individual right. Of course, judges aren’t moral philosophers either. \n",

      "So having them go back and look at the history, those are familiar things to lawyers and they’re things that all justices consider. As I said earlier in the hearing, all justices do consider the history and the original meaning, and that’s been true since the beginning of the court itself throughout the 19th century, this idea of originalism isn’t new. \n",
      "So\n",
      " throughout the 19th century and all throughout the 20th, the court has resorted back and looked to see what the original meaning is. It’s just that I would say the difference between those who identify themselves as originalists and those who just consider it is the amount of weight that they give it. \n",

And we want to have that she’s been mentioned several times today. So as a point of clarification, we would want to mention this.

And we have seen this happen with other judges that have come before us. Judge Naomi Rao, Wendy Vitter, they have been criticized.

What they prefer to have is that very narrow, liberal viewpoint. And I look forward to the day when that will stop because all women deserve the opportunity to rise.

      "Instead, Justice Gorsuch reasoned the fourth amendment protects only those searches included in the original text, searches of persons houses, places, and affects. Some critics of originalism complained that today’s laws should not be governed by the dead hand of the past.

      " they couldn’t have anticipated the internet or cell phones or airplanes for that matter. But one can reason from the kinds of privacy protections that were in place in 1791 when the fourth amendment was ratified to see if the search of modern technology now is analogous to it.\n",

Barrett answered questions about Roe v. Wade, the Affordable Care Act, gun regulation, and more. Read the transcript of the full hearing with Barrett’s testimony here.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '01:43', ')', '[crosstalk 00:01:43] … 30 minute period today, then come back Wednesday and finish up. Then we’ll go on about our business. ', 'So', ' I will try, I’ll make sure I stay within 30 minutes for sure, and if I can shorten it up, I will. ', 'So', ' let’s get to it. You can start the clock. ', 'So', ' you can relax a bit here, judge, and take your mask off. So yesterday we had a lot of the discussion about the Affordable Health Care Act. What I’m going to try to do very briefly this morning is to demonstrate the difference between politics and judging. ', 'All of', ' my colleagues on the other side had very emotional pleas about Obamacare, charts of people with pre-existing conditions. I want to give you my side of the story about Obamacare.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '02:31', ')', 'Now, this is Lindsey Graham, the Senator from South Carolina talking. This is not a question directed at you. From my point of view, Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina. All of you over there want to impose Obamacare on South Carolina. We don’t want it. We want something better. We want something different. You know what we want in South Carolina? South Carolina care, not Obamacare. Now, why do we want that? Under the Affordable Care Act, three states get 35% of the money, folks. Can you name them? I’ll help you. California, New York, and Massachusetts. They are 22% of the population. Senator Feinstein’s from California, Nancy Pelosi’s from California. Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic Senate is from New York, and Massachusetts is Elizabeth Warren. Now, why do they get 35% of the money when they are only 22% of the population? That’s the way they designed the law. The more you spend, the more you get.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '03:37', ')', 'What does it mean for the people of South Carolina? If you had a per patient formula, where you got the same amount from the federal government to the state whether you lived in Charleston, Columbia, or San Francisco or New York City, if you leveled that out, it’d be almost a billion dollars more for us in South Carolina. ', 'So', ' to my friends over there, we’re going to fight back. We want our money. If you’re going to have money allocated for Obamacare, we’re not going to sit back and quietly let you give 35% of it to three states. What else has happened in South Carolina? Four rural hospitals have closed because the revenue streams are uncertain. 30% increase in premiums in South Carolina for those on ', 'Obamacare. I was on Obamacare for a few years before I got on track here. My premiums went up 300%. My coverage was almost non-existent. A $6,000 deductible.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '04:40', ')', 'So I want a better deal, and that’s a political fight. I’m in a campaign at home. If it were up to me, we would block grant this money, send it back to the states in a ', 'more fair', ' allocation, and we would require pre-existing conditions to be covered as part of the block grant. We want sick people covered. But I got an idea. I think South Carolina may be able to deal with diabetes better and different than California. If you want good outcomes in medicine you need innovation, and the best way to get innovation is to allow people to try different things to get better outcomes. ', 'So', ' the debate on healthcare is consolidating all the power in Washington, have some bureaucrat you’ll never meet running this program versus having it centered in the state where you live. Under my proposal, South Carolina would get almost a billion dollars more. The state of South Carolina would ', 'be in charge of', ' administering Obamacare. They couldn’t build football stadiums with the money. They ', 'have to', ' spend it on healthcare. They’d have to cover pre-existing conditions.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '05:47', ')', 'But, as a patient in South Carolina, you would have a voice you don’t have today. If you didn’t like what was happening to you on the healthcare front, you could go to local officials and complain, and the people you’re complaining to live in your state. They send their family to the same hospital as you go. That’s a structural difference. That’s got nothing to do with this hearing. It’s got everything to do with politics. We on this side, do not. And the difference between analyzing a lawsuit and having a political argument is fundamentally different, and I hope to be able to demonstrate that over the course of the day. And I hope that my colleagues on this side of the aisle will not feel shy about telling my colleagues on the other side of the aisle why we think we have a better idea on healthcare. Now, the bottom line here, judge, you said yesterday something that struck ', 'me', ' and I want the American people to understand what you meant.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '06:45', ')', 'You said you’re an originalist. Is that true?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '06:47', ')', 'Yes.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '06:48', ')', 'What does that mean, in English? Pass the button. I mean, we all love Senator Lee, but in English.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '07:00', ')', 'In English. Okay. ', 'So', ' in English that means that I interpret the Constitution as a law, that I interpret its text as text, and I understand it to have the meaning that it had at the time ', 'people ratified it. So that meaning doesn’t change over time and it’s not up to me to update it or infuse my own policy views into it.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '07:22', ')', 'So in other words, you’re bound by the people who wrote it at the time they wrote it. That keeps you from substituting your judgment for theirs. Is that correct?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '07:29', ')', 'Yeah.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '07:30', ')', 'All right. Justice Scalia. He was an originalist, right?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '07:34', ')', 'Yes, he was.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '07:34', ')', 'People say that you’re a female Scalia. What would you say?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '07:38', ')', 'I would say that justice Scalia was obviously a mentor, and as I said when I accepted the President’s nomination, that his philosophy is mine too. He was a very eloquent defender of originalism, ', 'And', ' that was also true of textualism, which is the way that I approach statutes and their interpretation. And ', 'similarly', ' to what I just said about originalism, for textualism, the judge approaches the text as it was written with the meaning it had at the time and doesn’t infuse our own meaning into it. But I want to be careful to say that if I’m confirmed, you would not be getting Justice Scalia. You would be getting Justice Barrett. And that’s so because originalists don’t always agree and neither do textualist. Justices Scalia and Thomas disagreed often enough that my friend, Judge Melissa Parr, teaches a class called Scalia Versus Thomas. It’s not a mechanical exercise.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '08:38', ')', 'Well, I’ll wait till the movie comes out. ', 'So', ' the bottom line for me is there’s a narrative building in this country, and again, you can stand down, this is just me speaking for me. Justice Ginsburg was an iconic figure in American history, just not the law. She was a trailblazer. She fought for better conditions for women throughout society. She was unashamedly progressive in her personal thought. She was devout to her faith. She worked for the ACLU. She was proudly pro-choice personally. But all of us on this side, apparently when they voted, accepted that she was highly qualified. What I want the American people to know. I think it’s okay to be religiously conservative, I think is okay to be personally pro-choice, I think is okay to live your life in a traditional Catholic fashion, and you’d still be qualified for the Supreme Court. ', 'So', ' all the young conservative women out there, this hearing to me is about a place for you.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '09:40', ')', 'I hope when this is all over that there’ll be a place for you at the table. There’ll be a spot for you at the Supreme Court like there was for judge Ginsburg. And to President Trump, I don’t know if you’re listening or not, by picking Judge Barrett you have publicly said you find value in ', 'all of', ' these characteristics. But beyond anything else you find Judge Barrett to be highly qualified. I would say you’re one of the greatest picks President Trump could have made, and from the conservative side of the aisle, you’re one of the most qualified people of your generation. Let’s talk about Brown vs. Board of Education, because I know Senator Blumenthal will. I’m going to talk about that. You said in writings, it was a super precedent. What did you mean?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '10:28', ')', 'Well, in my writings, so as a professor, I talked about the doctrine of Stare Decisis, and super precedent is not a doctrinal term that comes from the Supreme Court and I think maybe in political conversation or in newspapers, people use it different ways. But in my writing, I was using a framework that’s been articulated by other scholars. And in that context, super precedent means precedent that is so well established that it would be unthinkable that it would ever be overruled. And there are about six cases on this list that other scholars have identified.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '11:03', ')', 'Let’s talk about Brown and talk about why it would be unthinkable. First, let’s talk about, what’s the process that would lead to it being overruled? What would have to happen?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '11:15', ')', 'For Brown to be overruled, you would have to have Congress or some state or local government impose segregation again, [crosstalk 00:11:25].', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '11:25', ')', 'Okay, let’s stop right there. If you want to make yourself famous, by the end of the day, you can say, “We want to go back to segregation,” I promise you, you’ll be on every cable TV channel in America. I doubt if you’ll go very far, but the point we’re trying to make here is the court just can’t wake up and say, “Let’s revisit Brown.” It ', 'has to', ' be a case in controversy, is that right?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '11:46', ')', 'Yes, that’s right.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '11:47', ')', 'So before a Brown decision, you could review Brown, somebody out there would have to be dumb enough to pass a law saying, “Let’s go back to segregated schools.” Is that fair to say?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '11:57', ')', 'That is fair to say.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '11:58', ')', 'Do you see that happening anytime soon?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '12:00', ')', 'I do not see that happening anytime soon.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '12:02', ')', 'Yeah, I don’t either. ', 'So', ' let’s talk about the process in general. There’s the Heller case. What’s that about?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '12:09', ')', 'The Heller case is a case decided by the Supreme court, which held that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '12:18', ')', 'Okay. Now, my friends on the left, some of them have a problem with Heller. They may try to challenge the construct of Heller. If a state or local government passed a law in defiance of Heller, what would happen?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '12:30', ')', 'In defiance of Heller?', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '12:31', ')', 'Or that was challenging the construct of Heller?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '12:34', ')', 'That challenge, the construct of Heller, if it was brought in a lower court, Heller binds. I mean, lower courts always ', 'have to', ' follow a Supreme Court precedent.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '12:44', ')', 'And if the Supreme Court wanted to revisit Heller, what would they do?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '12:50', ')', 'If someone challenged Heller below, because a state or local government passed a law contradicting Heller, the Supreme Court would have to take that case once it was appealed all the way up. ', 'So', ' the Court would have to decide, “Yes, we want to overrule Heller and we have enough votes to grant cert,” and then do so.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '13:07', ')', 'So that’s the way the process works?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '13:09', ')', 'Yes, it would start because there was a law. Then there was a lawsuit. Then there was an appeal. And then the court granted cert, and then the court decided the case.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '13:17', ')', 'Is that true no matter what the issue is? Whether it’s gun, abortion, healthcare, campaign finance, does that process hold true for everything?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '13:26', ')', 'Yes. Judges can’t just wake up one day and say', ', ”', ' I have an agenda. I like guns. I hate guns. I like abortion. I hate abortion,” and walk in like a royal queen and impose their will on the world. You ', 'have to', ' wait for cases and controversies, which is the language of the Constitution, to wind their way through the process.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '13:46', ')', 'All right. Well, Senator ', 'Sasse', ' gave us a good civics lesson. I hope that’s the basic lesson in law here. ', 'So', ' if a state said, “I don’t think you should have over six bullets,” and somebody believed that violated the Second Amendment, there would be a lawsuit and the same process would work, right?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '14:03', ')', 'The same process would work. In that case, there would be parties would have to sue the state arguing that, that law was unconstitutional. It would wind its way up, and if it got to the Supreme Court and if the Supreme Court decided to take it, a whole ', 'decision making', ' process begins. You hear arguments from litigants on both sides. They write briefs. You talk to clerks as a judge. You talk to your colleagues. Then you write an opinion. Opinions circulate, and you get feedback from your colleagues. ', 'So', ' it’s an entire process. It’s not something that a judge or justice would wake up and say, “Oh, we’re hearing this case. I know what my vote is going to be.”', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '14:46', ')', 'Let’s talk about the two Supreme Court cases regarding abortion. What are the two leading cases in America regarding abortion?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '14:54', ')', 'Well, I think most people think of Roe vs. Wade, and Casey is the case after Roe that preserved Roe’s central holding, but grounded it …', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '15:03', ')', 'Roe that preserved Roe’s central holding, but grounded it in a slightly different rationale.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '15:05', ')', 'So what is that rationale?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '15:07', ')', 'Rationale is that the state cannot impose an undue burden on a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '15:14', ')', 'Okay. Unlike Brown, there are states challenging on the abortion front. There are states that are going to a fetal heartbeat bill. I have a bill, judge, that would disallow abortion on demand at the 20 weeks, the fifth month of the pregnancy. We’re one of seven nations in the entire world that allow abortion on demand at the fifth month. The construct or my bill is, because the child is capable of feeling pain in the fifth month. Doctors tell us to save the child’s life, you ', 'have to', ' provide anesthesia if you operate because they can feel pain. The argument I’m making is if you ', 'have to', ' provide anesthesia to save the child’s life, because they can feel pain, it must be a terrible death to be dismembered by an abortion. That’s a theory to protect the unborn at the fifth month. If that litigation comes before you, will you listen to both sides?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '16:12', ')', 'Of course. I’ll do that in every case.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '16:13', ')', 'So I think 14 states have already passed a version of what I’ve just described. So there really is a debate in America still, unlike Brown versus Board of Education, about the rights of the unborn. That’s just one example. ', 'So', ' if there’s a challenge coming from a state, if a state passes a law, and it goes into court where people say, “This violates Casey,” how do you decide that?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '16:41', ')', 'Well, it would begin in a district court, in a trial court. The trial court would make a record. The parties would litigate and fully develop that record in the trial court. Then it would go up to a court of appeals that would review that record, looking for error. And then, again, it would be the same process. Someone would have to seek certiorari at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court would have to grant it. And then at that point, it would be the full judicial process. It would be briefs, oral argument, conversations with law clerks in chambers, consultation with colleagues, writing an opinion, really digging down into it. It’s not just a vote. You all do that. You all have a policy, and you cast a vote. The judicial process is different.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:23', ')', 'Okay. ', 'So', ' when it comes to your personal views about this topic, do you own a gun?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:33', ')', 'We do own a gun.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:34', ')', 'Okay. All right. Do you think you could fairly decide a case even though you own a gun?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:41', ')', 'Yes.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:42', ')', 'All right. You’re Catholic.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:43', ')', 'I am.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:44', ')', 'I think we’ve established that. The tenants of your faith mean a lot to you, personally. Is that correct?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:51', ')', 'That is true.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:51', ')', 'You’ve chosen to raise your family in the Catholic faith. Is that correct?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:55', ')', 'That’s true.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '17:56', ')', 'Can you set aside whatever Catholic beliefs you have regarding any issue before you?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '18:02', ')', 'I can. I have done that in my time on the Seventh Circuit. If I stay on the Seventh Circuit, I’ll continue to do that. If I’m confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will do that still.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '18:10', ')', 'And I would dare say that there are personal views on the Supreme Court, and nobody questions whether our liberal friends can set aside their beliefs. There’s no reason to question yours, in my view. ', 'So', ' the bottom line here is that there’s a process. You fill in the blanks, whether it’s about guns and Heller, abortion rights. Let’s go to Citizens United. To my good friend, Senator Whitehouse, me and you are going to come closer and closer about regulating money. Because I don’t know what’s going on out there, but I can tell you there’s a lot of money being raised in this campaign. I’d like to know where the hell some of it’s coming from. But that’s not your problem. Citizens United says what?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '18:57', ')', 'Citizen United extends the protection of the first amendment to corporations who are engaged in political speech.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '19:03', ')', 'So if Congress wanted to revisit that and somebody challenged it under Citizens United, that Congress went too far, what would you do? How would the process work?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '19:14', ')', 'Well, it’d be the same process I’ve been describing. First, somebody would have to challenge that law in a case, somebody, presumably, who wanted to spend the money on a political campaign. It would wind its way up, and judges would decide it after briefs, and oral argument, and consultation with colleagues, and the process of opinion writing.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '19:33', ')', 'Okay. Same-sex marriage. What’s the case that established same-sex marriage as the law of the land?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '19:40', ')', 'Obergefell.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '19:41', ')', 'Okay. If there was a state who tried to outlaw same-sex marriage, and there’s litigation, would it follow the same process?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '19:51', ')', 'Well, it would. And one thing I’ve neglected to say before that’s occurring to me now, is that not only would someone have to challenge that statute. If they outlawed same-sex marriage, there’d have to be a case challenging it. And for the Supreme Court to take it up, you’d have to have lower courts going along and saying, “We’re going to flout Obergefell.” And the most likely result would be that lower courts, who are bound by Obergefell, would shut such a lawsuit down. And it wouldn’t make its way up to the Supreme Court. But if it did, it would be the same process I’ve described.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '20:26', ')', 'Well, let’s turn now to Senator Hawley’s favorite topic, substantive due process. As a legal theory, what am I talking about? Can you explain it for the country? Because if you can’t, we’re in trouble. I think I’ll have a hard time doing it.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '20:41', ')', 'So both the 14th and 5th Amendments protect life, or provide that the state cannot take life, liberty, or property without due process of law. And that sounds like a procedural guarantee, but in Supreme Court precedent, it has a substantive component. And ', 'so', ' the substantive due process clause says that there are some liberties, some rights that people possess, that the state can’t take away or can’t take away without a really good reason. ', 'So', ' the right to use birth control, the right to an abortion, are examples of rights protected by substantive due process.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '21:14', ')', 'These are judicially created rights, not found in the document called the Constitution. Is that correct?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '21:19', ')', 'Well, the Supreme Court has grounded them in the Constitution, although they’re not-', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '21:23', ')', 'But they’re not written.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '21:24', ')', 'They’re not expressed.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '21:25', ')', 'Okay. ', 'So', ' is it fair to say there’s a great debate in the law about how far this should go and what limits should apply, if any?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '21:34', ')', 'That’s fair to say. There’s also a lot of debate in Supreme Court opinions. I’m not aware of anybody proposing to throw it over entirely, but there’s certainly a debate about how to define these rights and how far it should go.', 'Chairman Lindsey Graham: (', '21:45', ')', 'Well, let’s just say that you’re in the camp, or anybody’s in the camp, that substantive due process, as a legal concept, is unbounded. It basically makes the Constitution no more certain than the five people interpreting it at any given time in the country. Whatever rights they think you have, you get. Whatever rights they want to take away from you, they can. It’s a pretty nebulous legal concept. That’s sort of my view of it. I’m not imposing my views on yours. But then there’s a thing called precedent. Let’s say you didn’t like a case decided under substantive due process, you thought the whole concept was Constitutionally an era.

During her confirmation hearing, before this committee, in 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked several questions about her views on whether the Constitution protects a woman’s right to abortion.

She explained it like this, and I quote, ', '“The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It’s a decision she must make for herself.

I think on that question, I’m going to invoke Justice Kagan’s description, which I think is perfectly put. When she was in her confirmation hearing, she said that she was not going to grade precedent or give it a thumbs up or thumbs down, and I think in an area where precedent continues to be pressed and litigated, as is true of Casey, it would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that as a sitting judge.

I ', 'have to', ' confess that I would need to look at the statute and the precedent to… Well, even if I had a specific hypothetical in front of me, I couldn’t really say without looking at the statute and the precedent what factors are involved, because I wasn’t on that panel and haven’t decided a similar case.', 'Senator Dianne Feinstein: (', '54:30', ')', 'Okay. Let me go to another issue. The issue of LGBT equality is very personal for me. I spent two decades as a county supervisor and mayor of a city. I watched firsthand as the LGBT community fought for legal recognition of their lives, their relationships, their personal dignity. I was there before the loss, so I saw in San Francisco what was happening.', 'Senator Dianne Feinstein: (', '55:02', ')', 'I want to speak briefly about one couple, Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, who I met in the 1970s. They were vibrant members of San Francisco’s community. I was President of the Board of Supervisors, they worked with me to pass a city-wide ordinance in 1978, that provided critical protection against discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations. At that time, this was one of the strongest protections for the gay community in the entire nation. We’ve come a long way since then, and I think we should never go back. In June of 2008, 58 years after they met, my two friends were finally able to marry, when the California Supreme Court ruled that same sex couples cannot be denied the fundamental right to marry. Del died two months later. Because of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, Phyllis was denied social security survivor benefits, even though her spouse had paid into this basic safety net for her entire working life. ', 'Phyl', ' had to rely on the help of friends and fellow activists. In 2013, as you probably know, because you know so much about this, US v. Windsor, the Supreme Court struck DOMA down. Two years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court recognized that the fundamental right to marry could not be denied to LGBT Americans. Both decisions were decided by a five to four margin. Justice Ginsburg was in the majority. Justice Scalia dissented in both cases.', 'Senator Dianne Feinstein: (', '56:56', ')', 'Now, you said in your acceptance speech for this nomination, that Justice Scalia’s philosophy is your philosophy. Do you agree with this ', 'particular point', ' of Justice Scalia’s view that the US Constitution does not afford gay people the fundamental right to marry?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '57:17', ')', 'Senator Feinstein, as I said to Senator Graham at the outset, if I were confirmed, you would be getting Justice Barrett, not Justice Scalia. So I don’t think that anybody should assume that just because justice Scalia decided a decision a certain way, that I would too, but I’m not going to express a view on whether I agree or disagree with Justice Scalia, for the same reasons that I’ve been giving. Justice Ginsburg with her characteristic pithiness used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing: “No hints, no previews, no forecasts.” That had been the practice of nominees before her, but everybody calls it the Ginsburg Rule because she stated it so concisely, and it’s been the practice of every nominee since. ', 'So', ' I can’t, and I’m sorry to not be able to embrace or disavow Justice Scalia’s position, but I really can’t do that on any point of law.', 'Senator Diane Feinstein: (', '00:12', ')', 'Well, that’s really too bad because it’s rather a fundamental point for large numbers of people I think in this country. I understand you don’t want to answer these questions directly, but you identify yourself with a Justice, that you like him would be a consistent vote to roll back ', 'hard fought', ' freedoms and protections for the LGBT community. And what I was hoping you would say is that this would be a point of difference where those freedoms would be respected, and you haven’t said that.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '00:55', ')', 'Senator, I have no agenda, and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference. Like racism, I think discrimination is abhorrent. On the questions of law, however, because I’m a sitting judge and because you can’t answer questions without going through the judicial process, can’t give answers to those very specific questions.', 'Senator Diane Feinstein: (', '01:26', ')', 'Okay, thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.', 'Senator Lindsey Graham: (', '01:28', ')', 'Thanks Senator Feinstein, Senator Grassley.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '01:31', ')', 'Judge, I welcome you again and you can rest for a minute because I’ve got some things to say to my colleagues, but more importantly, so people around the country understand what’s going on here. ', 'First of all', ', for your family and friends, I’m sure they’re very proud and they ought to be. I think everybody recognizes your sharp intellect, a deep understanding of, and even great reverence for the Constitution. Your legal experience and public service are impressive. Your dedication to mentoring young students and women in the legal profession ought to be admired by everybody. In all respects, you’re exceptionally qualified to be a justice. Many groups and individuals have written in strong support. So I guess now that the chairman is gone, I’m going to ask as the next one ranking, I got some ', 'letters from 21 state Lieutenant Governors and from 20 Secretaries of State that I want to put in the record at this point.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '02:40', ')', 'Before I question, I have a few points to make. Yesterday, my Democrat colleagues spoke about their concern that you, Judge, wouldn’t uphold certain laws, including the Affordable Care Act. And that you would strip Americans of their healthcare rights and those protections that come with it. These opponents said that Republicans just want to confirm you so that you, “will carry their policies forward.” Meaning Republican policies forward on the Supreme Court. But this only shows Democrats fundamentally misunderstand what judges are supposed to do. A judge is supposed to interpret laws in an impartial manner, consistent with the Constitution. Republicans aren’t interested in seeing judges, “carry their policies forward.” Republicans want judges to interpret the law and the constitution not make law. We want judges that won’t impose their policies and personal preferences in their decision making, plain and simple.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '04:02', ')', 'Policymaking is not the proper role of the judicial branch. That role is reserved for legislative and executive branches. As the judge said, the political branches elected by and accountable to the people because you got a lifetime appointment. And if you do lawmaking, we can’t vote you out of office. Lawmaking’s our job, if people are all like what we do, they can vote us out of office. Some other points on the Affordable Care Act, the Democrats continue to misrepresent or claim to know Barrett’s view on affordable care and access to healthcare. In fact, they made it their entire game plan yesterday. And I suppose today we’ll see it again. But we should dispense with the total fiction the Democrats are pedaling. ', 'Apparently', ' her technical concerns with Chief Justice Roberts legal reasoning in the Obama decision disqualifies her. Democrats are painting the judge as heartless ', 'and on a mission', ' to scrap the healthcare law. Frankly, that’s absurd.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '05:24', ')', 'Not only is Judge Barrett a mother of seven, she had children with pre-existing medical challenges of her own. No one on this committee or anyone has any right to suggest that she doesn’t care about access to healthcare or protection for the vulnerable. Now, getting back to the technical concerns about Robert’s Affordable Care Act opinion. First, and I got four points along this line, her comments dealt with Robert’s statutory interpretation of just one provision of the law. That provision is no longer even in effect. In 2017, Congress zeroed out the so-called tax, the tax connected with the individual mandate. The question before the court this fall are entirely separate. She never ruled on the Affordable Care Act, nor commented on how she’d vote. Meaning the Judge, how she would vote. ', 'So', ' it’s pointless to speculate, but we’re going to get a lot of speculation during this election season, just two and a half weeks before the election.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '06:43', ')', 'Now second point. Lawyers and legal academics often consider a court reasoning even when they have no disagreement with the outcome of the case. For instance, the New York Times recently reported, Ginsburg, before joining the Supreme Court, “Wasn’t really fond of Roe v. Wade. She didn’t like how it was structured.” I don’t blame or don’t know why Democrats have a different standard for you, Judge Barrett. Now a third point. It’s blatantly inconsistent for the left to use this line of attack. We all know that President Obama said that the ACA legislative mandate was not a tax. Even liberal Jeffrey ', 'Toobin', ' said Robert’s argument was, “Not a persuasive one.” ', 'So', ' Judge Barrett’s analysis of Robert’s legal reasoning is well inside the mainstream. Now a fourth point, more inconsistency. The same Democrats vilify Judge Barrett as a threat to those with pre-existing conditions.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '08:08', ')', 'Well, it seems that those same people just filibustered the COVID relief bill that would have protected pre-existing conditions. They’re the ones that blocked the COVID relief legislation. Republicans stood ready to move forward with that bill and remain ready. Seems to me it’s the other side who really playing politics with healthcare during a pandemic. The truth is Judge Barrett already said, “A judge must apply the law as written.” She further commented, “To decide cases according to the rule of law, beginning to end.” That’s what we should all look for judges to do. Now for my first question, when Justice Scalia came to my office before his confirmation, and I think I brought this up with every nominee to the Supreme Court by Republican or Democrat nominees. I don’t think I brought it up in my private conversation with you, but I always bring up, what’s your attitude about legislative history?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '09:27', ')', 'Um-', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '09:28', ')', 'Let me ask my question first.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '09:29', ')', 'Sorry.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '09:29', ')', 'I’m sorry.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '09:31', ')', 'I thought that was it.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '09:32', ')', 'I think you probably know, Judge, how important it is. I want to know how important legislative history is to you. When is it appropriate to look to legislative history, to interpret the statute? And are there some circumstances when more appropriate than ', 'other? And I’d like to also give your view on legislative history compared to what I heard from Scalia 35 years ago.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '09:59', ')', 'Sure. ', 'So', ' I’m very comfortable talking about the use of legislative history because that’s a matter of interpretive philosophy. What governs of course, is the text of the statutes. ', 'So', ' the legislative history can never supersede the text and it should never substitute for the text of the statute. Justice Scalia as was well-known railed against the use of legislative history. And I think it was because at the time that Justice Scalia went onto the D.C. circuit before he was on the Supreme Court, the use of legislative history had really kind of gotten out of control. And many courts were saying things, Justice Scalia in his book, quotes this line from a brief, “The legislative history being unclear, we turned to that other reliable guide in statutory interpretation, the statute.” And that has things backwards. And ', 'so', ' I think Justice Scalia really tried to clean that up and say, listen, the priority is the text. And when the text answers the question, you don’t go to legislative history. And there’s some pragmatic reasons to be careful about doing so.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '11:06', ')', 'Legislative history can be long. There’s a famous quotation from Judge Levinthal that, “Legislative history is like going to a cocktail party and picking out your friends, can be easy to manipulate because there might be something in there for everyone.” So ', 'as a general rule', ', I don’t look to legislative history when I’m deciding cases. I wouldn’t say that it would never be relevant. Even Justice Scalia himself said that there could be instances. For example, if you were trying to determine whether a term used in a statute, how it was used, if it had a technical meaning, or how it was understood, that that might be an appropriate time to consult legislative history. Or Justice Scalia himself consulted it when he was trying to determine whether there had been an error in the way the statute was drafted. He looked at legislative history to see whether what seemed unthinkable ', 'actually was', ' unthinkable.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '12:01', ')', 'Now I’d like to go to a specific case. I’d like to go to United States v. ', 'Uarte', ', which involved the interpretation of Section 403 of the First Step Act, which I had a big part along with Senator Lee and Senator Durbin in getting that passed in 2018. This is the most significant criminal justice legislation in a generation, our criminal justice system can’t just punish and deter. It must also rehabilitate and promote successful re-entry into society. The First Step Act accomplished these goals through prison and sentencing reform. It was well-known that the goal of the First Step Act was to make smart and cost-effective changes to the criminal code and to reduce a risk of recidivism. ', 'So', ' I want to ask you about your dissent in this case, the issue was whether the sentencing reform provision of the First Step Act applied to a defendant whose sentence had been vacated. Here the defendant had been convicted, but not re-sentenced at the time of the First Step Act becoming law.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '13:18', ')', 'The majority opinion cited the plain meaning of the First Step Act in congressional intent in finding that Section 403 would apply to a defendant with a vacated sentence. Your dissent, as I understand it, argued among other things that congressional intent shouldn’t be heavily relied on, “Every statute requires a resolution of competing policy interest.” President Trump signed the First Step Act into law only two years ago. ', 'So', ' wouldn’t re-referencing congressional intent be accessible and relevant? And then another question, why did you find the majority relying on legislative history unpersuasive?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '14:05', ')', 'So we did, the majority. It was a very, very difficult case. It was voted on, on bunk by our full court. And the quote from my dissent that you’re pointing to was ', 'actually that', ' we had a dispute about what the plain text of the statute required. And so that portion of my dissent that you just read was saying that I thought that the majority had permitted the policy goals of the act to supersede the text. And in dissent, I argued that the text drew the line after someone had been sentenced. ', 'So', ' if someone had already been sentenced on the date of the First Steps Act’s passage and the relevant language was, if a sentence had already been imposed. I thought with my dissenting colleagues, and this was consistent with the approach the third circuit had already taken that, that meant if the person had already been through sentencing. And this case involved a re-sentencing, and re-sentencing can happen years after. And ', 'so', ' it didn’t seem to my dissenting colleagues and I that looking in the statute that the plain language of the text supported the majority’s approach to it.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '15:22', ')', 'Now I think on my next question on the same case, you may have just partially answered it, but let me go ahead with my lead in, and then also a question. Both the majority and your dissent in the case reviewed 403 of the Act under a plain reading of the text. As an author and leader in this law’s passage, I’d like to discuss how a plain reading of the statute could lead to varying outcomes. The section in question contemplates, when a sentence has been imposed on a defendant, according to the text’s statute and relevant case law, a defendant sentence, if vacated creates a clean slate. That means defendant is placed in the same position as if he had never been sentenced. But your dissent comes to the opposite conclusion on whether a sentence has been imposed. Note, that I agree with you that the laws need to be read and interpreted literally. ', 'So', ' my question is this, how could we come to different conclusions?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '16:28', ')', 'Well, that language that it did not apply to defendants on whom sentences had already been imposed, my dissenting colleagues and I said, well, the language is sentences. It doesn’t say invalid sentences. And one could certainly say, if asked if someone had been sentenced, yes, he was sentenced, but that sentence was later vacated. And you’re right ', 'that the majority relied heavily on this clean slate principle. But in my review of the law, this clean slate principle wasn’t ', 'really present', ' because the sentencing reform act for example, instructs district courts applying the guidelines at sentencing to ply those that were in effect on the date of the original sentencing. ', 'So', ' I thought that the clean slate principle, they were pushing a little too hard on it. And there’s certainly unfairness, the First Step Act, ', 'it’s', ' policy is clearly to bring justice to sentencing. But whenever you draw a line at who gets the benefit of a law, and this is especially acutely true in the sentencing area, it’s very difficult.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '17:40', ')', 'And some people ran on either side of the line will not get the benefit of the law wherever you draw it. So, for example, in this case, Mr. ', 'Uarte', ' had a co-defendant named Sparkman, his case came up right behind … together. They had been tried together and initially sentenced together, but ', 'Uarte’s', ' appeal took longer to resolve, or his re-sentencing took longer because of a lot of delays. ', 'So', ' there was unfairness there too in the majority’s approach because ', 'Uarte', ', despite the fact that he was more culpable than Sparkman, wound up with a sentence that was like 15 years less.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '18:19', ')', 'That’s the end of my questioning on that, but let me make a comment before I go to my next question, my position has always been that legislative history can be instructive with respect to the intent of the statute so judges should not completely disregard it. ', 'Certainly', ' I acknowledge that the legislative branch can be more careful about drafting laws. But I also think that judges should pay attention to congressional intent as set forth in history, when there might be a dispute about how to interpret the statute. Justice Ginsburg at her hearing quote, and you’ve discussed this a little bit already, but I think it deserves emphasis because you’re going to go through a lot of this business of maybe not being … and I know legitimately not being able to comment on a prospective case. ', 'So', ' she said, “A judge sworn to decide impartiality can offer no forecasts, no hints for what would show not only disregard for the specifics of this particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.”', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '19:29', ')', 'Obviously, we all know that that’s the Ginsburg standard. The underlying reason for this rule is that making promises or giving hints on how a judge would rule in a case undermines the very independence of our system. But you’re going to be asked about your personal views as you just have been on various topics, and how you might correctly decide. Of course, the judicial nominee should never promise their future votes on the bench in exchange for the president’s nomination or a senator’s support, you’d be showing the opposite of independence. So my question, so I ask you, do you agree with the Ginsburg standard that it goes to the question of judicial branches independence for legislative history, and all you got to do is say yes, because I’ve heard you talk about it.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '20:27', ')', 'Yes, I agree the Ginsburg rule reinforces judicial independence.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '20:33', ')', 'Yeah. Now here’s something that a lot of people’s suspicion. ', 'So', ' I want to ask you, have you made any promises or guarantees to anyone about how you might rule on a case or issue that might come before you if you’re confirmed to the Supreme Court?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '20:51', ')', 'I want to be very, very clear about this Senator Grassley. The answer is no. And I submitted a questionnaire to this committee in which I said, no, no one ever talked about any case with me, no one on the executive branch side of it. One reason you asked that question, I think as a committee, is that you want to know that no nominee has made any pre-commitments. And so just as I didn’t make any pre-commitments and was not asked to make any commitments on the executive branch side, I can’t make any pre-commitments to this body either. It would be inconsistent with judicial independence.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '21:25', ')', 'No, I know the answer to my last question and then Mr. Chairman, I’m going to reserve the rest of my time. The Democrats claim that you’re being put on the Supreme Court so you can vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Is that your agenda, if confirmed, is your goal repealing the Affordable Care Act? Have you committed to the President or anyone else that you will vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act if confirmed to the court?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '21:50', ')', 'Absolutely not. I was never asked and if I ', 'had’ve', ' been, that would have been a short conversation.', 'Senator Chuck Grassley: (', '21:55', ')', 'I think that your record shows that you’ll be a faithful judge that takes each case seriously and approach each case in a non-biased way rather than with the policy agenda in mind.

It’s obvious that family is very important to you as it should be. My wife and I have been married for 58 years and our children, and our grandchildren are the most important things in our life. And I was pleased to see you introduce the family. Now as a senator, of course, another important part of my life is referring to and representing the people of Vermont. And let me talk to you about some of the things I’ve been hearing from Vermonters. And you ', 'have to', ' understand in Vermont, Vermonters just walk up to the grocery store or coming out of church or whatever, and perfectly happy to express their views. And they’re concerned about what the Republican’s Affordable Care Act lawsuit on November 10th would mean for them. Now, do you know how many Americans have attained insurance through the Affordable Care Act?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '23:45', ')', 'I do not.', 'Senator Patrick Leahy: (', '23:47', ')', 'It’s more than 20 million.

And do you know how many Americans are covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '24:10', ')', 'I do not.', 'Senator Patrick Leahy: (', '24:12', ')', 'It’s a little more than 15 million. And I look at that because I look at the people who called me from Vermont. I think of Alex Johnson, she’s a single mother, she’s a childhood cancer survivor. She works as a nanny in South Burlington, Vermont. She relies on Medicaid for her doctor’s visits or blood drawings, or other testing. All that done to make sure her ', 'leukemia stays in remission. She tells me she stays awake at night worrying about losing Medicaid. Now, if the Republicans are successful in what they’re trying to do on November 10th, then Alex and ', 'actually 60,600', ' other Vermonters enrolled in Medicaid expansion are going to be left behind. [inaudible 00:25:12] contract COVID-19, that’s seen as a pre-existing condition. Do you know approximately how many million Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus and survive?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '25:28', ')', 'I do not.', 'Senator Patrick Leahy: (', '25:29', ')', 'It’s more than 7 million, 700,000, those are people now considered to have a pre-existing condition. And one of the most common pre-existing conditions is diabetes. The CDC estimates that 34 million Americans, that’s about one in 10 Americans have diabetes. This shows that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion is the single most important factor for expanding access to affordable insulin. Leslie, a Vermonter diagnosed with late onset type 1 diabetes at age of 25. For years, she’s dependent on Medicaid to keep her alive and out of bankruptcy. Now, President Trump recently claimed that he’s made insulin as cheap as water. I wish he had told the truth of ', 'that,', ' we all know it’s not. Leslie now has insurance to pay for insulin. And without this insurance, do you know how much … because unlike what the President says, insulin is not as cheap as water.

', 'So', ' I’m not suggesting that you’re callous or indifferent to the consequences if the Affordable Care Act is overturned, you know that these are real cases and I think you’re a sympathetic person.

Some are going to pretend that’s a mystery and that’s what some of my colleagues have [inaudible 00:27:53] what a Justice Barrett would do when the Supreme Court takes up the leaves attack in the ACA. President Trump has made crystal ', 'clear,', ' he’s promised his nominees would overturn the ACA. It’s even in the official Republican Party platform.

He says he needs a ninth justice because he’s counting on the court to look at the ballots. And he says, the election will be rigged. The recusal statute, 28 USC 455 requires recusal where partiality might reasonably be questioned. Now, when the President declares he needs his nominate to secure his reelection, and then the nominee is rammed through the Senate in record time during the middle of an election.

I have had no conversation with the President or any of his staff on how I might rule in that case. It would be a gross violation of judicial independence for me to make any such commitment or for me to be asked about that case and how I would rule. I also think it would be a complete violation of the independence of the judiciary for anyone to put a Justice on the court as a means of obtaining a particular result, and that’s why, as I was mentioning, I think to Senator Grassley, that the questionnaire that I fill out for this committee makes ', 'clear that I have made no pre-commitments to anyone about how I would decide a case.

Now, Judge Joan Larsen of the Sixth Circuit sat next to you during your 2017 hearing. She was confronted with this issue as a judge on the Michigan Supreme Court in 2016.

She found that being on the short list was a conflict and it required her recusal. You were also on the short list, then you were ', 'actually chosen', '. Now he’s not the President-elect, he’s the President. And then the President makes a similar thing as he did that Judge Larson looked at. He’s counting on you to deliver him the election.

Is that correct?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '37:06', ')', 'Senator Leahy, I’m not familiar with Judge Larson’s decision, but she clearly made it once it was presented to her in the context of an actual case where she had to weigh her obligations under 28 U.S.C. 455. If presented to me, I would, like Judge Larson, apply that statute, and I recently read a description by Justice Ginsburg of the process that Supreme Court justices go through in deciding whether to recuse. And it involves not only reading the statute, looking at the precedent, consulting counsel if necessary, but the crucial last ', 'step is that while it is always the decision of an individual justice, it always happens after consultation with the full court.

But this president has not been subtle in the expected nominee to side with him in election dispute. I’m thinking of the credibility of our federal courts. And I had hoped you would at least consider that. The President has said he needs a ninth Justice because he’s counting on the court to look at the ballots in case he loses, because if he lost, and that the Democrats had rigged the election. They recusal statue, as you know as well as anyone in 28 U.S.C. 455 requires a Justice recused herself in any proceeding in which impartiality might reasonably be questioned.', 'Senator Patrick Leahy: (', '39:14', ')', 'Now, whether you like it or not, and I suspect you probably do not, the President has placed both you and the Supreme Court in the worst of positions.

I think that’s not quite what I said in the interview. It was an interview that I gave shortly after Justice Scalia’s death. And at that time, both sides of the aisle were arguing that precedent supported their decision. And I said while I had not done the research myself, my understanding of the statistics was that neither side could claim precedent, that this was a decision that was the political branches to make. And I didn’t say which way they should go. I simply said it was the Senate’s call. I didn’t advocate or publicly support the blockade of Judge Garland’s nomination as you’re suggesting.', 'Senator Patrick Leahy: (', '43:19', ')', 'That’s not what I’m suggesting. You said it was a lateral. It would not be a lateral move.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '43:28', ')', 'What I was suggesting is that it was unsurprising that there was resistance as a political matter to that nomination because it would change the balance of the court.

I was just saying that we had many members of our committee, number of Republicans, who prior to the vacancy had been saying Garland would be a good person for President Obama to nominate because he could appeal to moderates, conservatives and liberals. And then of course their response was, well, we can’t have a nominee confirmed by one party that’s in control of the Senate and nominated by a President of another party.

The ACLU sued the school district and obviously it made its way all the way to the Supreme Court. And I’m not going to ask you your opinion on the outcome of the case, but what troubles me the most, what troubled me the most about that experience is when the Supreme Court struck down or held that practice unconstitutional and in violation of the establishment clause.

Can you explain why?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '01:10:54', ')', 'I can. ', 'So', ' we’ve talked about precedent.

And I didn’t rule out the possibility that the government might be able to make that showing about Ricky Kanter.

Gun shows are held in Gary, Indiana, and other places. And when they’re selling these firearms without background checks, unfortunately, these gang bangers and thugs fill up the trunks of their cars with firearms and head into the city of Chicago and kill everyone from infants to older people.

He then went on to explain that it’s really important to maintain that clear distinction between will and judgment, lest you have the judicial branch, consisting of people who are not elected by the people, not accountable to the people at the regular intervals, and who serve basically for the rest of their lives, so long as they’re on good behavior.

There are strong reasons, I believe, why over the last more than a century and a half, we’ve left that number at nine. As you point out there’s nothing in the Constitution that requires it. We could come up with any number we wanted. There does have to be a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as we choose to create, but it doesn’t specify the number of seats that can be on there.

Roosevelt got tired of the so-called four horsemen of the apocalypse, a few members of the Supreme Court who were consistently voting against his agenda, and sometimes joined by one or more other members of the Supreme Court. He got particularly tired of this, and so he proposed packing the court. And let me explain what I mean by packing the court here. What I mean when I refer to this is increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court and doing so by statute with the intent of altering the composition of the court for short-term political gain. That’s what FDR wanted to do.', 'Senator Lee: (', '01:52:32', ')', 'Not withstanding', ' the fact that he had an overwhelming super majority in both houses of Congress, fortunately, FDR’s idea that he pushed in the fall of 1936 didn’t make it anywhere. It didn’t gain progress. It met enough opposition, even with both houses of Congress being overwhelmingly controlled by his political party, that it stalled, quite mercifully, and it’s remained ever since then at nine justices. I think it would have been a colossal mistake. Joe Biden, himself as a US Senator, as a member of this body, in a proceeding of this committee in 1983 gave a rousing speech that I recommend to all talking about that very thing.

Don’t pack the court.', 'Senator Lee: (', '01:53:27', ')', 'In recent days, I’ve seen some in the media and some in this body try to redefine what it means to pack the court. Some have suggested, well, court packing takes various forms, and it can mean confirming a lot of people all at once. Some have defined it so as to suggest that it consists of doing that which the Trump administration and the Republican Senate have been doing over the last three and a half years, which is filling vacancies as they have arisen and doing so with textualist, originalist judges. This may not be something that some like, but this is not court packing. Court packing is itself manipulative. It’s something that has great danger to do immense political and Constitutional harm to our system of government. In part, because it would set up a one-way ratchet. Once you create a position and confirm someone to that position, absent death, retirement, or impeachment and removal, that position remains in place.', 'Senator Lee: (', '01:54:28', ')', 'So if, for example, a future Congress and White House were to decide to get together and to pack the court and increase the number, say to 11. And let’s say it’s Democrats who do that. And we’ve got Joe Biden now as a Presidential candidate who’s refusing to say whether he would do it. There’s a reason he’s not saying whether he would do it. There’s only one reason why you refuse to answer that question, and it’s if you’re wanting to be able to do it, but you don’t want to take the heat for the fact that you’re thinking about doing it right now.', 'Senator Lee: (', '01:55:08', ')', 'So if they do that, where does it lead? Well, it inevitably leads to the point where the next time Republicans have control of both houses of Congress and the White House, they’d increase it as well. You’d end up increasing it incrementally. Before long, it looks like the Senate in Star Wars where you’ve got hundreds of people on there. I don’t know what the total number would be, but you increase it at all, you change the number at all, you do so for partisan political purposes at all, you de-legitimize the court. And you can’t de-legitimize the court without fundamentally threatening and eroding and impairing some of our most valued liberties.

We did hear a little from her that we know that her family owns a gun. We know that she and her family teared up when they watched the video of the death of George Floyd this summer. But when it comes to answering questions about how she would rule, what she would decide, how does that compare to what we’ve seen from other justices nominated in recent years?', 'Marcia Coyle: (', '01:59:29', ')', 'Well, Judy, I think it’s pretty clear that all nominees have learned sort of the magic words to say when they are asked about specific rulings by the Supreme Court, how they may rule on other issues, they’re just not going to make any kind of commitment or any statement that might reveal how they think about those particular issues. And ', 'so', ' we didn’t really learn a whole lot from Judge Barrett about issues that are common discussions and debates at dinner tables in America. I think that the hearing this morning really stayed focused on each side’s goals here. You saw that the Democrats who were singularly focused yesterday on the Affordable Care Act followed up on that. I’d say the Affordable Care Act, abortion, and guns were the topics they were most interested in, and that was because they have a little more meat to deal with. They have some of Judge Barrett’s opinions on the Seventh Circuit, as well as writing and speeches. ', 'So', ' they did try to learn more about her through those, but I think they scored limited points.', 'Judy Woodruff : (', '02:00:51', ')', 'Democrats, I was going to say, Democrats certainly did come back at those questions time and again. John Yang, on several occasions, we heard Judge Barrett say, and it came out at the very beginning when Lindsey Graham, the Chair, asked her to compare herself to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, because she has called him her mentor. He asked her, would you be another Judge Scalia? And she made a point of saying she’d be different.', 'John Yang: (', '02:01:27', ')', 'She said she’d be Justice Barrett. I think it’s also, to sort of add on to what Marcia was saying, we learned, or she spoke more about her judicial philosophy. But I think that was clear from her previous writings that she’s an originalist, she goes back to what the words meant when the Constitution was ratified or when the amendments were ratified. And she is a textualist, she goes after the words on the paper. She doesn’t care, not doesn’t care, but she does not give precedence to legislative intent, what the lawmakers said when they pass laws.', 'John Yang: (', '02:02:03', ')', 'But I don’t know that that is necessarily a predictor of how she would rule, as was pointed out before, yesterday. The current, one of the leading originalists and textualists on the court now, is Neil Gorsuch. And he ruled earlier this year that Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans discrimination against gay men, lesbian women, and transgender Americans. That was hotly contested by two other originalists, contextualist, Justices Alito and Thomas, who said in their dissent that this was not a textual exercise, that all Gorsuch had done was rewrite Title Seven to meet the current standards. ', 'So', ' it’s really not a predictor at all. As she says, originalists and textualists can disagree, and they do.', 'Judy Woodruff : (', '02:03:00', ')', 'And Victoria ', 'Nourse', ', we did hear her make that point. And we also heard her in several question and answer exchanges, say that on the ACA, when it comes to the Affordable Care ', 'Act, also known as Obamacare, that the case coming before the court in November is based on a different question from the case that was decided several years ago, in which the Chief Justice ruled one way in a way that she was critical of.

But I think what you really need to know about this methodology here, which is behind this is it can predict something. And it predicted that cases such as King v. Burwell, which was the first one up there on text, or this current case would never have gone up there when I was a law student, because textualism didn’t exist. Textualism allows a judge to pick and choose texts. They don’t think that, but that’s what happens. And these cases would have been considered, “Well, I defer to the legislature.” ', 'So', ' there is something more I think you can predict. Yes, they come out with different results sometimes, but that’s because the method isn’t determinative in any way.', 'Victoria ', 'Nourse', ': (', '02:04:38', ')', 'So they believe that it restrains. But in fact, the data shows that it doesn’t constrain. And you know, I think one of the ways you can see this is if you look at the gun decision that Senator Durbin was talking about, because she’s to the right of Scalia on that. He said that gun felon laws in Heller were fine. Now she said that was dicta. But in that case, she basically claimed, “Oh, I’m not going to decide anything about the consequences of this. And I’m going to rewrite the statute.” She rewrote the statute, as Durbin said, to add violent felony. Wisconsin wrote a statute that said felony, period. Why doesn’t it say all felonies? Well, she says, “No, it doesn’t because of the Constitution.” ', 'So', ' I think the method is something of a smoke screen here. John is actually ', 'right,', ' it doesn’t lead to results.

I think there were two possible textual readings of the Anti-Discrimination Act, and Gorsuch and Thomas and Alito ably demonstrated those two possible readings. They disagree with themselves, but that’s not uncommon. The textualist slash originalist approach doesn’t yield one answer in many cases. And that’s not a fault of the theory, it’s the fault of imprecision in language. And I say this as someone ', 'who is an originalist, but who’s not a textualist. I kind of have Professor ', 'Nourse’s', ' approach to statutory interpretation. I think it’s appropriate to look at legislative history.', 'Saikrishna', ' Prakash : (', '02:06:40', ')', 'And if you listen very carefully today, Judge Barrett didn’t deny that legislative history can be relevant in certain cases.

And I suspect that some people are more apt to say it’s unclear than she would be. But I don’t think that it’s just a smoke screen for ideology. I do think that texts ', 'constrains', '. And I think the alternative approach, I think, is to think that text doesn’t and shouldn’t constrain judges and they should do what they want.

I’ll say that I was on a call with two Democratic Senators on the committee this morning, Senators Durbin and Blumenthal. They held this for reporters to talk about their strategy today going into questions. And the strategy that Democrats said they were going to pursue, at least what Senator Blumenthal said, is they wanted to show that Amy Coney Barrett’s ideas are radical and extreme. That while she is clearly very smart, capable, that she has high intellect, in their view that her reading of the law is extreme.

They haven’t really used words like extreme or radical, which are things that Senator Blumenthal was using. He’s still a couple hours ahead. I think about three hours ahead in the hearing. But I think if they’re trying to make the case that Judge Barrett is way out of step with judicial norms, they haven’t gone that far. They seem to have instead done more to say that she could affect people’s lives. That’s a political message that also has to do with the election. Now, on the other hand, Republicans have their own strategy. As Democrats want to show Judge Barrett as being extreme, Republicans are trying to make the case that it’s Democrats who are extreme, that they are willing to do anything to push out a nominee who they see as credible. And that also of course has to do with the election and trying to convince voters which side is more reasonable and better for the future of this country.', 'Judy Woodruff : (', '02:09:18', ')', 'Marcia Coyle, let me come back to you on that. These hearings are being held just a matter of days, less than three weeks, before election day. We know Americans have been going to the polls already for days, millions have already voted.

And she did emphasize that within those guidelines is recusal if there is an appearance of bias. ', 'So', ' I think that’s as far as she was willing, obviously it’s as far as she was willing to go. I’m sure it wasn’t what the Democrats wanted to hear.', 'Marcia Coyle: (', '02:10:43', ')', 'Judy, I’d like to go back a bit first to the Affordable Care Act and her comment that the issue before the court in November is not the same issue that was before the court in the 2012 case, the first case to go to the Supreme Court, as well as in King v. Burwell, the second case. And that is correct. It’s not the same issue, but I think the point that the Democrats were trying to make is that the stakes are very much the same. Especially [inaudible 02:11:20] yes, the question is different. But if the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of the Republican led states and the Trump administration that are challenging the act, the entire act could fall.

But there also has been considerable debate about whether the laws should be as strict as they are when it comes to non-violent felons. But as of today, her dissent really was, I don’t think you would call it radical, but I would say that she pretty much stands alone in her view of the Indiana law, as well as the federal law that prohibits felons from having guns.', 'Marcia Coyle: (', '02:12:34', ')', 'And in the broader context, Judy, the Second Amendment is still very much an issue in the Supreme Court.

Cases that covered so many of the issues that have been percolating in the lower courts. And the common wisdom on this is that the court, that ', 'there really are four justices who would like to take another gun case and four votes are all you need to grant review, but those four justices were never really sure that they had a fifth vote in the end for the view that they wanted to see the court adopt.

They are primarily dependent upon the parties to raise cases and ask for them being overturned. And in that context, most cases aren’t before the court. Litigants aren’t asking the courts to overturn a bunch of cases. And in that context, the judges don’t have some duty to independently come up with those ideas on their own.

There is no magic number about nine as a Judge Barrett I think correctly said. The constitution says that Congress should decide how many justices there are on the Supreme Court.

Another procedural thing to watch, though, that is closer at hand, Judy is Democrats are discussing if they can find some way to delay the vote in committee on Judge Barrett. There is an idea that they can prevent the committee from having a quorum on Thursday, which is when Chairman Graham wants to sort of initiate the voting process for the committee.

If there’s some dispute in the election and whether it ends up in the court or not, what has he said about that?', 'Yamiche', ' Alcindor: (', '02:26:36', ')', 'Well, the president has made it very clear that he believes he needs his Supreme Court nominee to be confirmed, in this case being Judge Barrett, because he believes that Democrats are trying to rig the election. There is no evidence that Democrats are trying to do that. There is no evidence that there is some mass voter fraud by mail, but the President has continued to say that. And as a result, he said that if there is some sort of election issue that makes it to the Supreme Court in response specifically to the general election, that he wants his nominee to be there so that he can win the case. He wants that nominee to vote in favor of him. He’s made that very clear ', 'over and over again', '.

Who has put it out there that you might be wanting to help the President politically?” And he said, “All you have to do is look at the President’s tweets and he’s the one that put it out there. He’s the one who originates that idea.” So you saw Judge Barrett over and over again not want to talk about how she would rule in whether it was an election case or whether it was Roe V Wade, but the president has made it very clear how believes she would rule based just on the fact that he has nominated her. He said in 2016 that he wanted to overturn Roe V Wade. He said just a few weeks ago that he wants her to vote in his favor. ', 'So', ' it’s put Judge Barrett in a tough position because she’s not saying what her views are, but the president has essentially offered what her views are.', 'Judy Woodruff : (', '02:28:12', ')', 'And coming back to you, Marsha Coyle, her answer… I know Senator Leahy raised it, Senator Durbin raised it, she would not be pinned down. She said she would consult.

And to be honest, I wouldn’t expect her to. I would like to say something though. The Supreme Court has been an election issue since the early 1800s. And for the most part, it’s been about cases that the Supreme Court has decided. Brown vs. Board of Education was an election issue. Reg V Scott was an election issue. But recently, more recently, and in particular in the 2016 presidential election, the debate seemed to ', 'move', ' or the trends seem to move sharply in another direction.

And his aides are thinking about the proper judicial philosophy, the proper outcomes, certainly if you’re a Democratic president and compiling that list. But as a Professor ', 'Nourse', ' said, they’re not asking these people how they’re going to vote. If you believe in living constitutionalism, you’ll want to appoint someone who’s more likely to be a progressive on these issues because you will think that the progressive judge will bend to that outcome. If you’re a conservative, I think you’ll be more inclined to the idea that judges shouldn’t be legislating from the bench and you’ll favor originalist judges.

I wanted to say too, that we ', 'have to', ' remember that the nomination and confirmation process is a political process. These nominees, whoever they are, do become nominees because they have made contacts over the years, they have mentors that may be politically connected, and that’s how they come to the attention of a White House.

Why is it surprising for us to be concerned that you want this nominee to do what you want nominees to do? One quick stop on NFIB V Sebelius, because a lot of this has to do with money. This is an interesting comparison. National Federation of Independent Businesses, until it filed the NFIB versus Sebelius case, had its biggest donation ever of $21,000.

The Republican party platform says it will reverse Roe. Why would we not comment on that and take you at your word? Senators here, including Senator Hawley, have said, “I will vote only for nominees who acknowledge that Roe V. Wade is wrongly decided”, and they’re pledged to vote for this nominee. Do the math.

And in that case, there were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 amicus briefs filed. And every single one of them was a group funded by something called Donors Trust. Donors Trust is a gigantic identity scrubbing device for the right wing so that it says Donors Trust is the donor without whoever the real donor is. It doesn’t have a business. It doesn’t have a business plan. It doesn’t do anything. It’s just an identity scrubber. And this group here.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:50:03', ')', '… Vanity scrubber. And this group here, the Bradley Foundation, funded 8 out of the 11 briefs. That seems weird to me when you have an Amicus briefs coming in little flotillas that are funded by the same groups, but nominally separate in the court. So, ', 'actually attach', ' this to my brief as an appendix.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:50:24', ')', 'Center for Media and Democracy saw it and they did better work. They went on to say which foundations funded the brief writers in that CFPB case. Here’s the Bradley Foundation. For 5.6 million to those groups. Here’s Donors Trust, 23 million to those brief writing groups. The grand total across all the donor groups was $68 million. So, the groups that were filing Amicus briefs, pretending that they were different groups, and it’s not just in the consumer financial protection board case, you might say, “Well, that was just a one-off.”', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:51:06', ')', 'Here’s Janice, the anti-labor case, that had a long trail through the court through Friedrichs and through Knox and through other decisions. And Source Watch, and ProPublica did ', 'some work about this. Here’s donor’s trust and donor’s capital fund, and here’s the Bradley Foundation. And they totaled giving $45 million to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 groups that filed an Amicus briefs pretending to be different groups. And ', 'both of the lawyer', ' groups in the case. Funded by Donors Trust, funded by Bradley Foundation and Janice. This is happening over and ', 'over and over again', '. And it goes beyond just the briefs. It goes beyond just the Amicus presentations. The Federalist Society. Remember this group that is acting as the conduit and the Donald Trump has said is doing his judicial selection? They’re getting money from the same foundations. From Donors Trust, $16.7 million. From the Bradley Foundation, $1.37 million. From the same group of foundations, total, $33 million.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:52:23', ')', 'So, you can start to look at these and you can start to tie them together. The legal groups, all the same funders ', 'over and over again', ', bringing the cases and providing this orchestrated chorus of ', 'Amiki', '. Then, the same group also funds the Federalist society over here. The Washington Post wrote a big expose about this and that made Leonard Leo a little hot, a little bit like a burned agent. So, he had to jump out and he went off to go and do anonymously funded voter suppression work. Guess who jumped in to take over the selection process in this case for Judge ', 'Barrett?', ' Carrie Severino made the hop. So, once again, ties right in together.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:53:16', ')', 'So, the Center for Media and Democracy’s done a little bit more research. Here’s a Bradley Foundation memo that they’ve published. The Bradley Foundation is reviewing a grant application, asking for money for this orchestrated Amicus process. And what did they say in the staff recommendation? “It is important to orchestrate,” their word not mine, “important to orchestrate high caliber Amicus efforts before the court.” They also note that Bradley has done previous philanthropic investments in the actual underlying legal actions. So, Bradley is funding. What do they call? Philanthropic investing in the underlying legal action and then giving money to groups to show up in the orchestrated chorus of Amici. That can’t be good.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:54:12', ')', 'And it goes on because they also found this email. This email comes from an individual at the Bradley Foundation, and it asks our friend Leonard Leo, who used to run the selection process, “Is there a 501(c)(3) non-profit to which Bradley could direct any support of the two Supreme Court Amicus projects, other than donor’s trust?” I don’t know why they wanted to avoid the reliable identity scrubber donors trust, but for some reason they did. So, Leonard Leo writes back on Federalist society address, so don’t tell me that as the Federalist society business, on Federalist society, on his address, he writes back, “Yes, send it to the Judicial Education Project, which could take and allocate the money.” And guess ', 'who works for the judicial education project?

This, more and more, looks like it’s not three schemes, but it’s one scheme, with the same funders selecting judges, funding campaigns for the judges, and then showing up in court in these orchestrated Amicus flotillas to tell the judges what to do.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:56:11', ')', 'On the day judicial crisis network, you’ve got the Leonard Leo connection, obviously, she hopped in to take over for him with the Federalist Society.

To campaign for Supreme Court nominees, no idea who that is or what they got for it. You’ve got briefs that she wrote. The Republican Senators filed briefs in that NFIB case signed by Ms. Severino.

And it’s a $250 million dark money ', 'operation.” $250 million is a lot of money to spend if you’re not getting anything for it. So, that raises the question, what are they getting for it? Well, I showed the slide earlier on the Affordable Care Act and on Obergefell and on Roe vs. Wade. That’s where they lost. But with another judge, that could change. That’s where the contest is. That’s where the Republican party platform tells us to look at how they want judges to rule, to reverse Roe, to reverse the Obamacare cases, and to reverse Obergefell and take away gay marriage. That is their stated objective and plan. Why not take them at their word?', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '02:59:20', ')', 'But there’s another piece of it. And that is, not what’s ahead of us, but what’s behind us. What’s behind us is now 80 cases, Mr. Chairman, 80 cases under Chief Justice Roberts that have these characteristics. One, they were decided five to four by a bare majority. Two, the five to four majority was partisan in the sense that not one democratic appointee joined the five. I refer to that group as the Roberts five. It changes a little bit as with Justice Scalia’s death, for instance. ', 'But,', ' there’s been a steady Robert’s five that has delivered now 80 of these decisions.

Always the 5 4 unlimited money in politics, never protecting against dark money in politics. ', 'Despite the fact that', ' they said it was going to be transparent. And who wins when you allow unlimited dark money in politics? A very small group. The ones who have unlimited money to spend and a motive to spend it in politics. They win, everybody else loses.

We’ll see how that goes.', 'Sheldon Whitehouse: (', '03:01:37', ')', 'Next. Knock the civil jury down. Whittle it down to a nub. The civil jury was in the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, in our darn Declaration of Independence, but it’s annoying to big corporate powers because you can swagger your way as a big corporate power through Congress. You can go and tell the president, you put money into to elect what to do. He’ll put your stooges at the EPA. It’s all great until you get to the Civil Jury because they have an obligation, as you know, judge Barrett, they have an obligation under the law to be fair to both parties, irrespective of their size. You can’t bribe them. You’re not allowed to. It’s a crime to tamper with a jury. It’s standard practice to tamper with Congress. And they make decisions based on the law. If you’re used to ', 'being', ' the boss and ', 'swaggering your way around the political side, you don’t want to be answerable before a jury.

These five made that finding in Shelby County against bipartisan legislation from both Houses of Congress, hugely passed on no factual record. They just decided that that was a problem that was over.

And I think it speaks volumes that collectively, they’ve had very few questions for you. And virtually none calling into question your credentials, which are impeccable [crosstalk 00:03:08:33]. Your record. And what I think is, has been an extraordinary life you’ve led. So, that should be the source of great satisfaction in terms of the scholarly record and judicial record that you’ve spent a lifetime building. I want to start by asking you a question. Why is the first Amendment’s protection of religious Liberty?

What difference does that make in anybody’s life?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '03:09:35', ')', 'Well, I think all of the Bill of Rights, each and every one of them, is important to Americans because we value the constitution, including religious Liberty.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:09:46', ')', 'Well, how about the free speech protections of the first amendment? Why are those important?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '03:09:49', ')', 'So that minority viewpoints can’t be squashed. So that it’s not just the majority that can speak popular views. You don’t really need the first amendment if what you’re saying is something that everybody wants to hear, you need it when people are trying to silence you.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:10:07', ')', 'And how about the second amendment? Why is the right to keep and bear arms important?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '03:10:12', ')', 'Well, we’ve talked about Heller earlier this morning and what Heller tells us is that the second amendment protects an individual right to bear arms for self-defense.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:10:24', ')', 'Well, I think all of those rights, and I agree with you, the entire Bill of Rights is incredibly important to Americans. I also think what is really striking about this hearing today ', 'and also', ' yesterday, is that Senate Democrats are not defending what I think is really a radical agenda that they have when it comes to the Bill of Rights. And the topics they’re discussing today have little bearing to the rights that are really at issue and in jeopardy at the Supreme Court.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:11:02', ')', 'And so, let’s take a few minutes to go through them. ', 'First of all', ', we’ve had some discussion of Roe vs. Wade. You have declined to give an opinion on a matter that might be pending before the court. That is, of course, the same answer that every single sitting justice has given when he or she was sitting in the same chair you are. It is mandated by the judicial canons of ethics, whether one is a nominee of a Democratic president or a Republican president, that has been the answer that has been given to this committee for decades. ', 'But I do think it is interesting that our Democratic colleagues, number one, don’t discuss what would ', 'actually happen', ' if there came a day in which Roe vs. Wade were overruled. Which is namely that it would not suddenly become the case that abortion was illegal, but rather it would revert to the status of the law as it’s been for nearly 200 years of our nation’s history. Which is that the question of the permissibility of abortion as a question for elected legislatures at the state level and at the federal level.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:12:17', ')', 'And it is difficult to dispute that there are a great many jurisdictions, including jurisdictions like California and New York, who even if Roe vs, Wade were no longer the law of the land, their elected legislatures would almost certainly continue unrestricted access to abortion with virtually no limitation. What I find interesting though, is that our Democratic colleagues do not discuss what is really the radical position of the most liberal justices on the Supreme Court. Which is that no restrictions whatsoever are permissible when it comes to abortion.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:13:03', ')', 'Yesterday, one of the Democratic senators made reference to the case Gonzalez vs. Carhart. I’m quite familiar with that case. And I represented Texas and ', 'a number of', ' other States as a Miki in that case. That case concerned the constitutionality of the Federal ban on partial birth abortion. That was legislation that passed Congress was signed into law that made the ', 'really gruesome', ' practice of partial birth abortion, illegal. Overwhelming majority of Americans believe partial birth abortion should be prohibited. Even those who identify as ', 'pro choice', '. A significant percentage of Americans don’t want to see that gruesome practice allowed. Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4 in Carhart vs. Gonzales, upheld the federal ban on partial birth abortion. That means there were four justices ready to strike it down, ready to conclude that you can’t ban partial birth abortion, that you can’t ban late term abortion.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:14:04', ')', 'And by the way, other restrictions that are at question include parental consent laws, parental notification laws. None of our Democratic colleagues want to talk about the justices they want to see on the court would strike down every single reasonable restriction on unlimited abortion on demand that ', 'the vast majority of', ' Americans support. How about free speech? Well, we’ve heard quite a bit about free speech. The Senator from Rhode Island just gave a long presentation, complete with lots of charts. I’ll say a couple of things on free speech.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:14:48', ')', 'First of all, our Democratic colleagues when they address the issue of so-called dark money in campaign finance contributions, are often deeply, deeply hypocritical, and don’t address the actual facts that exist. Here are some facts. Of the top 20 organizations spending money for political speech in the year 2016, 14 of them gave virtually ', 'all of', ' their money to ', 'Democrats and another 3 split their money evenly. So, only 3 of the top 20 gave money to Republicans. What did that mean in practice? That meant the top 20 super PAC donors contributed $422 million to Democrats and 189 million to Republicans. Those who give these impassioned speeches against dark money, don’t mention that their side is funded by dark money with a massive differential. The Senator from Rhode Island talked about big corporate powers without acknowledging that the contributions from the fortune 500 in this presidential election overwhelmingly favor Joe Biden and The Democrats. Without acknowledging that the contributions from Wall Street in this election overwhelmingly favor Joe Biden and the Democrats.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:16:12', ')', 'It’s an awful lot of rhetoric about power.

We just heard an attack on the Federalist Society, a group that I’ve been a member of for over 25 years, I joined as a law student. It’s a group that brings Conservatives, Libertarians Constitutionalists together to have robust discussions about the Constitution and about the law.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:16:39', ')', 'What’s interesting is nowhere in the Senator of Rhode Island’s remarks was any reference to a company called Arab ', 'Baila', ' Advisors, which is a for-profit entity that manages non-profits including the 1630 Fund in the new Venture fund. Now what on earth are those? Those sound like awfully dark and can be confusing names. Well, according to the Wall Street Journal this Sunday, in the year 2017 and 2018, those entities reported $987.5 million in revenue. That’s nearly a billion dollars. We heard a lot of thundering indignation at what was described as $250 million of expenditures. In this case, you’ve got a billion dollars.', 'Senator Cruz: (', '03:17:33', ')', 'The Senator Rhode Island said that that much money, much of which is dark money that we don’t know who contributed it, he asked what are they getting for it?

There were two images of the 10 commandments carved on the wooden doors. As you walk out of the courtroom, you will soon be sitting looking at them. There are 40 images of the 10 commandments on the bronze gates on both sides of the courtroom. And then Judge Barrett, when you’re sitting at the bench above your left shoulder will be a phrase you know well. A phrase carved into the wall of great law givers, one of whom is Moses.

', 'So', ' you go out of your way in the case that Dick Durbin was discussing to make this distinction between voting rights and gun rights but now you won’t say whether or not you agree with Ginsburg. And ', 'so', ' my view is just based, again, following those tracks on this case, that you are most likely with the majority. But I know you’re not going to answer this. But what I do want you to know is this, and this is where it gets interesting, because of what Justice Ginsburg predicted in that dissent. According to the Brennan Center, over 20 states since that case came out that withdrew, that took away part of the protections from the Voting Rights Act, over 20 states have now made more restrictive voting laws than they did before that case.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:00:13', ')', 'Doesn’t that suggest to you that Justice Ginsburg had the better of the argument when she wrote that, “Throwing out pre-clearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet”? Do you think that that’s true? And I mean, it seems to me that the proof is in the pudding. Basically, this rainstorm that she said would come has come with all these states, including ', 'a number of', ' them that my colleagues over there represent have enacted stricter laws. Has it happened?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:00:54', ')', 'Senator Klobuchar, I want to clarify, you said I was answering Senator Durbin’s about the Second Amendment but refusing to answer yours. And ', 'so', ' I just wanted to clarify that I ', 'have written Kanter versus Barr, and so that’s why I was talking about it. But since I didn’t write Shelby, I can’t really talk about it. ', 'So', ' anything that I’ve written about or talked about, I would be happy to answer your questions.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:01:16', ')', 'Okay. All right. But, again, it just seems to me you went out of your way on that case and this is a case that is so real for so many people right now. And that while you can say it’s a fundamental right, the issue is that this case and the Voting Rights Act are so key. And let me just say why. We’re talking about the entire foundation of our democracy here. For centuries, Americans have fought and died to protect the right to vote, and so what matters is not just what you say about its being fundamental, it’s what you do. States like South Carolina, Texas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, have policies that make it harder for people to vote. And it’s a ', 'real world', ' thing before the Supreme Court.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:02:01', ')', 'In fact, back in May, when voters in Wisconsin were standing in line in the middle of a pandemic in homemade masks, in garbage bags, in the middle of a rainstorm, just to exercise their right to vote, 70 of them got COVID, because we didn’t know enough about it back then because the President hadn’t told us what he knew and we didn’t know enough to protect those voters. ', 'So', ' it ends up at the Supreme Court. What did Justice Ginsburg do? When the Republican appointed majority on the court ruled that voters in Wisconsin could not have more time to get their ballots in during the pandemic, she called them out in her dissent, in her blueprint for the future. And she said, “The majority opinion boggled the mind.” ', 'So', ' what boggles my mind? Well, two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the South Carolina report requirement that mail in ballots must have witness signatures, in the middle of a pandemic. You’ve got to go and get a witness.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:03:04', ')', 'In Texas, republicans have argued that the pandemic wasn’t a good enough reason to let people under age 65 vote by mail, despite the fact that over 42,000 Americans under 65 have died from COVID. And the Governor right now is forcing that state to have only one ballot box per county, including in Harris County where there are 4.7 million people. And for those of you that thought a judge took care of it a few days ago, he did. But then yesterday three Trump appointed judges came in and reversed that, so we’re back to one ballot box for people to drop their ballots off in a county of 4.7 million people. In Tennessee, Republicans have tried to prevent ballot drop boxes. I know, we had the Secretary of State as one of our witnesses at a rules committee hearing, and they have argued in court that COVID-19 is a valid excuse to vote by mail. In North Carolina, the Supreme Court struck down a core component of the Voting Rights Act. What happened? Well, states like North Carolina passed laws that were so egregious to make it harder to vote that the Fourth Circuit struck down their law and noted that it targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision. So that is what the states saw, and that is why ', 'not having Justice Ginsburg on the court right now is so frightening to so many Americans out there and that is why we are asking you these questions about voting. ', 'So', ' let me turn to another election question, gerrymandering. In 2015, Justice Ginsburg wrote the and majority opinion in Arizona State Legislature V the Arizona independent Redistricting Commission, holding that it was constitutional for the people of Arizona to amend the State Constitution to establish an independent redistricting commission.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:04:59', ')', 'Because of this case and Justice Ginsburg’s opinion, many argue now that Arizona has fairer electoral maps. The decision was 5-4. Here’s your example. And now Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy are no longer on the court. My question is this, must state legislatures abide by their own state’s Constitution when exercising their authority under the Elections Clause?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:05:28', ')', 'Senator Klobuchar, that would be eliciting an opinion from me about whether I agreed or disagreed with the result in that case.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:05:35', ')', 'Okay. Is it constitutional for voters to amend the state constitution to establish specific processes for election, like the voters in Arizona did to stop gerrymandering?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:05:47', ')', 'Again, you’re asking me for a view on that particular case and Justice Ginsburg herself gave the most famous articulation of the principle that constrains me from doing so, which is no hints, forecasts, or previous. ', 'So', ' I can’t express a view on precedent or on how I would decide any question that was provoked by the application of that precedent to a later case.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:06:08', ')', 'Okay, Last week, a contractor from outside of my state of Minnesota started recruiting poll watchers with special forces experience to protect polling locations in my state. This was clear voter intimidation. Similar efforts are going on around the country solicited by President Trump’s false claims of massive voter fraud. Something that, by the way, many Republican leaders, including Michael Steele, the former head of the Republican Party, including Tom Ridge, including Governor Kasich, including sitting Senator Romney have made very clear is not true. So as a result of his claims, people are trying to get poll watchers, special forces people, to go to the polls. Judge Barrett under federal law, is it illegal to intimidate voters at the polls?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:07:04', ')', 'Senator Klobuchar, I can’t characterize the facts in a hypothetical situation and I can’t apply the law to a hypothetical set of facts. I can only decide cases as they come to me, litigated by parties on a full record after fully engaging precedent, talking to colleagues, writing an opinion. And ', 'so', ' I can’t answer questions like that.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:07:26', ')', 'Well, I’ll make it easier. 18 USC 594 outlaws anyone who intimidates, threatens, coerces or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote. This is a law that has been on the books for decades. Do you think a reasonable person would feel intimidated by the presence of armed civilian groups at the polls?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:07:52', ')', 'Senator Klobuchar, that is eliciting. I’m not sure whether to say it’s eliciting a legal opinion from me because the reasonable person standard, as you know, is more common in the law, or just an opinion as a citizen. But it’s not something really that’s appropriate for me to comment on.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:08:08', ')', 'Okay. Here’s one that I think is, a selection of electoral college electors. You know that each state has laws that dictate how electoral college electors are selected. Judge Barrett, in 1932, the Supreme Court in Smiley V Holm, a case involving my state, ruled that the Minnesota State Legislature could not change election rules unilaterally. Do you agree that the unanimous opinion in Smiley V holm, which has never been questioned by any other Supreme Court case, is settled law?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:08:44', ')', 'I’ll say two things about that. ', 'First of all', ', I was not aware of that case. ', 'So', ' you’ve taught me something. But secondly, I can’t comment on the precedent, “Give thumbs up or thumbs down,” in Justice Kagan’s words.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:08:55', ')', 'Okay. Well, why don’t we end there with precedent? And I think that’s a good way to end here. So you wrote in your 2013 Texas Law Review Article that you tend to agree with the view that when a justice is best understanding of the Constitution conflicts with Supreme Court precedent or case law, it is “more legitimate for her to follow her preferred view rather than apply the precedent.” And I want to run through a few examples. ', 'So', ' Brown V board of Education, as we know, that holds that the 14th Amendment prohibits states from segregating schools on the basis of race. ', 'So', ' is that precedent that can’t be overruled?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:09:38', ')', 'Well, that is precedent, and as I think I said in that same article, it’s super precedent. People consider it to be on that very small list of things that are so widely established and agreed upon by everyone calls for ', 'it’s', ' overruling simply don’t exist.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:09:55', ')', 'Okay. Well, you also separately acknowledged that in a Planned Parenthood V Casey, the Supreme Court’s controlling opinion talked about the reliance interests on Roe V Wade, which it treated in that case, as super precedent. Is Roe a super precedent?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:10:13', ')', 'How would you define super precedent?', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:10:17', ')', 'Actually, I thought someday I’d be sitting in that chair. I’m not. I’m up here. ', 'So', ' I’m asking you.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:10:22', ')', 'Well, people use super precedent differently.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:10:24', ')', 'Okay.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:10:25', ')', 'The way that it’s used in the scholarship and the way that I was using it in the article that you’re reading from was to define cases that are so well settled that no political actors and no people seriously push for their overruling. And I’m answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn’t fall in that category. And scholars across the spectrum say that doesn’t mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively, it does mean that it’s not a case that everyone has accepted and doesn’t call for its overruling.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:10:56', ')', 'Okay, so here’s what’s interesting to me. You said that Brown, and I know my time is running out, is a super precedent. That’s something the Supreme Court has not even said, but you have said that. ', 'So', ' if you say that, why won’t you say that about Roe V Wade, a case that the courts controlling opinion in that Planned Parenthood V Casey case has described as a super precedent? That’s what I’m trying to figure out.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:11:22', ')', 'Well, Senator, I can just give you the same answer that I just did. I’m using a term in that article that is from the scholarly literature. It’s ', 'actually one', ' that was developed by scholars who are certainly not conservative scholars, who take a more progressive approach to the Constitution. And again, as Richard Fallon from Harvard said, “Roe is not a super precedent because calls for its overruling have never ceased, but that doesn’t mean that Roe should be overruled.” It just means that it doesn’t fall on the small handful of cases like Marbury versus Madison and Brown versus the Board that no one questions anymore.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:11:58', ')', 'Is United States V Virginia Military, is that super precedent?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:12:03', ')', 'Senator Klobuchar, if you continue to ask questions about super precedents that aren’t on the list of the super presidents that I discussed in the article that are well acknowledged in the Constitutional law literature, every time you ask the question, I will have to say that I can’t grade it.', 'Amy Klobuchar: (', '04:12:19', ')', 'Okay. Well, I am then left with looking at the tracks of your record and where it leads the American people. And I think it leads us to a place that’s going to have severe repercussions for them.

Judge, you have said that the meaning of law doesn’t change with time and you’ve said that’s very important. Can you unpack for us why it’s so important that the meaning of a law doesn’t change with time?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:13:14', ')', 'Sure. Because the law stays the same until it is lawfully changed, and if we’re talking about a law that has been enacted by the people’s representatives, or gone through the process of constitutional amendment or constitutional ratification, it must go through the lawfully prescribed process before it’s changed. ', 'So', ' Article Five in the context of the Constitution or bicameralism and presentment in the context of statutes, and it’s not up to judges to short circuit that process by updating the law. That’s your job.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:13:49', ')', 'But laws clearly are written in a context and then the things, the circumstances to which those laws have applied would change. Does the Fourth Amendment have nothing to say about cell phones? Unreasonable search and seizure ', 'was', ' obviously not written at a time when they had imagined mobile technological devices that addicted our kids. Does the Fourth Amendment have nothing to say about cell phones?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:14:12', ')', 'No, the Fourth Amendment, so the Constitution, one reason why it’s the longest lasting written constitution in the world is because it’s written at a level of generality that’s specific enough to protect rights, but general enough to be lasting so that when you’re talking about the constable banging at your door in 1791 as a search or seizure, now we ', 'can apply it, as the court did in Carpenter versus the United States, to cell phones. ', 'So', ' the Fourth Amendment is a principle. It protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, but it doesn’t catalog the instances in which an unreasonable search or seizure could take place. So you take that principle and then you apply it to modern technology like cell phones or what if technological advances enable someone with Superman x-ray vision to simply see in your house so there’s no need to knock on the door and go in. Well, I think that could still be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:15:13', ')', 'I think this is a useful place to explain to the American people again what originalism is and why it’s a mistake to view it as a Republican position. I think that originalism is a part of a jurisprudential debate. It’s not a part of a policy continuum between Republicans and Democrats. I think it’s something that is useful for everybody who believes that three branches of government have two that are political and one that is not. So maybe it’s useful to just kind of back up and say, when you define yourself as an originalist, what does that mean? And then, how is it going to relate to that distinction between the principles that are timeless but applications that are clearly going to change by circumstance?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:15:53', ')', 'Right. So originalism means that you treat the constitution as law, because it commits these texts to writing, and in interpreting that law, you interpret it in accord with the meaning that people would have understood it to have at the time that it was ratified. And the reason that you do that is because, as I said, the law stays the same until it’s lawfully changed, otherwise, judges would be in the constitutional convention business of updating the law rather than allowing the people to take control of that. Now, in the case of the Constitution, as I said with the Fourth Amendment, many of its principles are more general. Unreasonable searches and seizures, free speech, those are things that ', 'have to', ' be identified or fleshed out or applied over time. ', 'So', ' the fact that there wasn’t the internet or computers or blogs in 1791 doesn’t mean that the First Amendment’s free speech class couldn’t apply to those things now. It enshrines a principle, and we understand the principle as it was at the time, but then it’s capable of being applied to new circumstances.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:17:08', ')', 'So when you define yourself as an originalist, what are the other schools of thought that are adjacent to it, and how do you think about the debates among those with other people that are now with you on the Seventh Circuit, for instance?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:17:26', ')', 'Sure. Well, Senator ', 'Sasse', ', I think one thing that it’s worth pointing out is that in the Academy, in any event where I’ve spent a large portion of my career, originalism is not necessarily a conservative idea. There is a whole school of thought, and so originalists are now a very diverse lot. And there is a school of originalism that’s more of a progressive originalism and is very committed to keeping the Constitution’s meaning just interpreting ', 'texts the way all originalists do to say that it has the meaning that it had at the time that it was ratified, but they tend to read it at a higher level of generality. ', 'So', ' all originalists don’t necessarily agree. And, in fact, there’s an advocacy group called the Constitution Accountability Center, which has routinely filed briefs in the Supreme Court, it writes briefs in support of originalism but taking it from a more progressive standpoint.', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:18:25', ')', 'I think probably people think, “Oh, it’s only conservatives who are originalists,” but actually it’s a more widely accepted view than that. I think that if you think about different strains of approaching constitutional texts, originalism is one. All judges and justices take account of history and the original meaning. It’s just that some weight at differently whereas originalists would give it dispositive weight when it’s discernible. Other approaches to constitutional interpretation may take a more pragmatic view and say in some instances, “Well, that may have been the historical meaning, but that’s an uncomfortable fit for current circumstances so we will tweak it a little bit to adjust it to fit these circumstances, that situation.” Sometimes it’s called living constitutionalism, that the constitution can evolve and change over time. Sometimes it’s called a more pragmatic constitutionalism.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:19:24', ')', 'So I want to make sure we’ve established this fact clearly together, because one of the things that I think is really unhelpful for the American people when they see hearings like this over the last 20 years is there is an assumption that those of us who’ve advocated for you over the course of the last three years must be doing it because we know something about your policy views, and we’ve seen the Beautiful Mind conspiracy theory charts, for instance, that this is about specific outcomes that people want. What I want is to have a judge who doesn’t want to take away the job of a legislature that’s accountable to the people.

Why do judges in our system wear robes?', 'Judge Amy Coney Barrett: (', '04:21:19', ')', 'Well, judges in our system where black robes and they started wearing black robes actually because Chief Justice John Marshall started the practice. In the beginning, justices used to wear colorful robes that identified them with the schools that they graduated from. And John Marshall, at his investiture, decided to wear a simple black robe. And ', 'pretty soon', ' the other justices followed suit and now all judges do it. And I think the black robe shows that justice is blind. We all dress the same.

You, in your questioning from Chairman Graham this morning, talked a little bit about the process of judicial decision making and you started with four steps and then added a fifth, and then I think added a sixth, because it turns out being a reactive branch is really reactive.

The Supreme Court takes cases when it needs to, most frequently, the reason it takes them as to resolve a division among the Courts of Appeal or the State Supreme Courts.

And yet I think about it from the standpoint of thoughtful, well-meaning Nebraska Democrats who hear that and they know I have a different policy view than they might on getting to portability and healthcare so people can keep their health insurance across job and geographic change, because that’s actually, what’s driving un-insurance in America over the last few decades.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:30:14', ')', 'It’s not primarily health status. It’s not primarily a pre-existing conditions or socioeconomics. The number one driver of un-insurance in American public life is that we change jobs a lot more frequently than we used to. And ', 'so', ' I have a different policy solution of how we would get to portability in healthcare than a lot of my Democratic colleagues. But those are policy disputes about a modern economy where people move around a lot, both geographically and in terms of employer sponsored health insurance relationships. Those contracts are not really the things that a nominee coming before the court is supposed to opine on because I don’t have any idea what your views are on healthcare, but I know that it’s not really the job of a judge to reflect on those things. And so I want to be sure that folks who hear this hearing and at the end of the process, they can have trust that you’re not a person who really wishes secretly you could be the queen of all healthcare and decide all these issues.', 'Ben ', 'Sasse', ': (', '04:31:09', ')', 'And so when you write your opinion it seems to me that one of the really humble things you’re doing is you’re saying, “In every case that’s come before me on the Seventh Circuit, I want to write this opinion from the standpoint of the losing party to understand what was the question before the court today and how did the court rule on that specific narrow thing?” Because, ultimately, I think you would believe given your jurisprudential tradition and given your view of judicial modesty and humility and your Scalia mentorship, my guess is there are times when you rule in cases where you go home at night and you take off your robe and you think the outcome is not the outcome you wish had been the case, but it wasn’t your job to ultimately decide all policy in American life.

But I think the gravamen, the core issue in recusal, is that any judge or justice should recuse themselves from a case in which their impartiality might reasonably ', 'be questioned.

They ', 'have to', ' have the ability for instance to hire and fire ministers, those who are going to perform religious functions. The state, the government cannot interfere with that.

The Trinity Lutheran case, which was not unanimous but as a recent, very important case as well. I will just say for myself that I think that the lines that the Supreme Court has drawn regarding the first amendment, regarding the status of houses of worship, regarding the rights of religious believers, that now more than ever it is vital that those be respected and that the constitution be fully enforced and that the line of cases that is now multi-years old that the Supreme Court has set out be followed.

The construct of my bill is because the child is capable of feeling pain in the fifth month, doctors tell us to save the child’s life. You ', 'have to', ' provide anesthesia if you operate because they can feel pain. The argument I’m making is if you ', 'have to', ' provide anesthesia to save the child’s life, because they can feel pain, it must be a terrible death to be dismembered by an abortion.

', 'So', ' if there’s a challenge coming from a state, if a state passes a law and it goes into court where people say, “This violates Casey,” how do you decide that?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '42:25', ')', 'Well, it would begin in a district court, in a trial court. The trial court would make a record. The parties would litigate and fully develop that record in the trial court. Then it would go up to a court of appeals that would review that record, looking for error. And then again, it would be the same process. Someone would have to seek certiorari at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court would have to grant it. And then at that point, it would be the full judicial process. It would be briefs, oral argument, conversations with law clerks and chambers, consultation with colleagues, writing an opinion, really digging down into it. It’s not just a vote. You all do that.

And one thing I’ve neglected to say before that’s occurring to me now, is that not only would someone have to challenge that statute. And somebody … so if they outlawed same-sex marriage, there’d have to be a case challenging it. And for the Supreme Court to take it up, you’d have to have lower courts going along and saying, “We’re going to flout Obergefell.” And the most likely result would be that lower courts, who are bound by Obergefell, would shut such a lawsuit down and it wouldn’t make its way up to the Supreme Court. But if it did, it would be the same process I’ve described.', 'Lindsey Graham: (', '46:10', ')', 'Well, let’s turn now to Senator Hawley’s favorite topic, substantive due process. As a legal theory, what am I talking about? Can you explain it for the country? Because if you can’t, we’re in trouble. I think I’ll have a hard time doing it.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '46:24', ')', 'So both the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments protect life or provide that the state cannot take life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

It basically makes the Constitution no more certain than the five people interpreting it at any given time in the country. Whatever rights they think you have, you get; whatever rights they want to take away from you, they can, is a pretty nebulous legal concept. That’s sort of my view of it and I’m not imposing my views on yours. But then there’s a thing called precedent. Let’s say you didn’t like a case decided under substantive due process, you thought the whole concept was constitutionally in error. How does precedent play?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '48:13', ')', 'So precedent is the principle that cases that have been decided by the Court before this one lands on the docket are presumptively controlling.

And I want to tell you about one of them from Sandy Hook, Connecticut, Natalie, who is shown here with her brother, Daniel. Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 2012, Daniel was seven.

In my highway patrol in North Carolina, 75% fewer applications to go into the troopers Academy and record high request for retirement, we see that in New York, we see it across this country. I think people are afraid because many people, including people on this committee, are unwilling to condemn the acts of violence in public safety out there and condemn violence against law enforcement, which is rampant.

I am going to also ask unanimous consent to put forth some articles or tweets from prominent people that I think kind of give you an idea of the guerrilla tactics that are being used right now.

And one of those chairs represents [Veronica Guevara’s 00:01:32:14] grandfather, who is pictured here with Veronica.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:32:23', ')', 'Veronica, who is from Iowa, has experienced the painful impact of the Trump administration’s failure to address the pandemic. Her family is composed of essential workers who are working on the front lines of this pandemic. Her mother, who worked at a fast food processing facility, caught COVID-19 at work and was eventually hospitalized for seven days. Thankfully, her mother recovered, but then her grandparents got COVID-19 and were admitted to the hospital, and although her grandmother recovered, sadly, her grandfather didn’t make it. After experiencing all of this tragedy, Veronica shared, “It is even more so insulting to see a Senate that is more concerned with rushing through a Supreme Court nominee rather than focusing on providing relief to all the hardworking people that gave them their current leadership positions.” Many Americans agree with Veronica. They’re sitting at their kitchen tables wondering how they’re going to buy food, how they’re going to pay rent.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:33:38', ')', 'Millions of them are out of… They don’t have jobs. They’re going to food banks for the first time in their lives. So rather than coming up with a bill that meets the needs of the urgency of this moment, Republicans are just coming up with piecemeal bills, that’s because we know that within your own caucus you can’t agree on one bill that fits the critical needs of this country. In fact, there are at least 20 Republicans we heard who have said we’re done, we’re not doing any more to help the Americans who are suffering with COVID. So, here we are racing forward with this nomination while the rest of the country is wondering, what the heck is the Senate doing, particularly the Senate Republicans?

As an area manager, a position held mostly by men, Lilly was paid less than ', 'all of', ' her male counterparts. When she eventually realized this stark in equality, she sued for pay discrimination and a jury agreed, but the Supreme Court kicked Lily’s claim out of the court for being too late. The conservative majority, including your mentor, Justice Scalia, interpreted Title VII’s 180-day time limit to mean that Lily had to have filed her claim within 180 days of when her salary was decided, instead of accepting the common sense approach of viewing her paychecks as an ongoing part of pay discrimination. ', 'Justice Ginsburg,', ' strongly disagreed with her conservative colleagues approach to the case.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:41:45', ')', 'In her dissent, she pointed out the many challenges women face in discovering pay disparities, including how many companies keep salaries confidential. In a stinging rebut she said, “The court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the insidious way in which women can be victims of pay discrimination.” In another case, in 2018, in Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, employees who have been illegally underpaid ', 'joined together', ' to seek back pay in court. To block this effort, their employers force them to sign an arbitration agreement prohibiting collective actions… They ', 'actually had', ' to sign these arbitration agreements in order to even have a job or keep their job. So, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, including Justice Scalia, sided with the company, they interpreted a general federal arbitration law to override two worker protections laws instead of recognizing that the worker protection laws fall sensibly within the exceptions in the arbitration law, meaning that the worker protections laws should prevail. Again, Justice Ginsburg strongly disagreed with the majority’s approach to the case.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:42:57', ')', 'In her dissent, she pointed out that blocking joint losses would deter most workers from seeking individual unpaid wage claims because of the cost of lawsuits and fear of retaliation. She warned the majority’s decision would result in hurting vulnerable, low wage workers. Now, those are the kinds of real life impacts, the reality of women who are ', 'not paid the same as their male counterparts because of sex discrimination happening that she has no way of finding out about or of workers who are forced to sign an arbitration clause that overrides other worker protection laws, those are the kinds of real world impacts. So, do you think Justice Ginsburg was wrong to consider real world impacts in her decision making?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '01:43:49', ')', 'Well, senator, both the case… You’re talking about Lily Ledbetter, both that case and Epic Systems are precedents of the court. And as I’ve said ', 'a number of', ' times during the hearing, I can’t really comment or grade thumbs up or thumbs down, as Justice Kagan put it, prior precedents, or say how I would have decided them.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:44:11', ')', 'Judge Barrett, they are precedents of the court that do not take into consideration the real world factors at play here. And in fact, in the case of Epic Systems, the court sided with the corporation as opposed to the workers who were trying to remedy a wrong, and in Lily Ledbetter, she was totally out in the cold, so again, the court did not. ', 'So', ' they established a precedent, all right, but it was a precedent that was not based on real life impacts. So, much as you sit here telling me that you would follow the law, after all the law, for example, the Affordable Care Act, that law embodies a policy that says we want as many people as possible to be covered under insurance, and if the affordable care act is struck down…', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:45:03', ')', 'Then if the Affordable Care Act is struck down, that policy, that law will be struck down. I know that there was some discussion about some distinction that you make about policy versus the law. And I find that distinction to be a fiction because every law, or most laws we pass, are supposed to have real world impacts. Otherwise, why should we pass a law? ', 'So', ' the fact that you’re not able to, I think it’s pretty clear. Let me rephrase that. You do consider Justice Scalia to be your mentor, that your judicial philosophy is in alignment with him. And I think we all acknowledge that Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg were at pretty much opposite ends of the spectrum. ', 'So', ' since Justice Ginsburg made it a policy, her approach was to look at the real world impact. Justice Scalia’s was not.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:45:58', ')', 'So I’d say that when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, the real world policy considerations that will not be taken into consideration by the conservative judges would mean that 23 million people could lose their healthcare, that 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions could lose critical protections for their healthcare, and more than 7 million Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 would probably be added to the group of people with pre-existing conditions. And millions of Americans would once again face lifetime limits on coverage for essential services. That 8.7 million women would lose coverage for critical maternity care services. And we know that Black and Native women ', 'are two to three times more likely to die than white women from pregnancy-related cases.

You’ve been also asked a lot of questions about ', 'whether or not', ' you would overturn Roe v. Wade. Clearly, President Trump expects that you would do so because as he said, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on the court, that’ll happen, meaning the reversal of Roe v. Wade will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:51:07', ')', 'And a number of us have mentioned that Senator, as far as Senator Hawley is concerned, where he said, I will only vote for those Supreme Court nominees who have explicitly acknowledged that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. And there’s a whole quote I have from him. But after you were nominated, Senator Hawley made clear that you passed his litmus test. And he said, “I think her record is awfully clear. I think that’s one where she meets my standard of having evidence in the record.” And by the way, he had noted that he expected this evidence in the record not from your post-nomination assurances to him. All your prior record, he said you met his standards. We usually expect justices to uphold and apply longstanding precedent, so was the president wrong in concluding that you would vote to overturn Roe v.

But Roe isn’t one of those cases, because we know that there are all kinds of challenges to Roe, basically because the states are very busy passing all these laws that limit a woman’s right to an abortion.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:54:45', ')', 'You also said in that speech that even if Roe is not overturned, you said, without overturning Roe, you explained, quote, the question is how much freedom the court is willing to let states have in regulating abortion. And ', 'so', ' there are 14 cases right now relating to state abortion restrictions making its way through the circuit court, and some of these are going to land in the Supreme Court.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:55:15', ')', 'And these 14 cases include the following restrictions. Six cases involve bans on abortion starting at gestational ages ranging from six to 24 weeks. Two cases involving bans on a ', 'particular type of procedure', ', dilation and evacuation, that accounts for nearly all second trimester abortions. One case involving a requirement that fetal remains be buried or cremated. Four cases involve laws imposing unnecessary requirements on abortion providers, like transfer agreements with local hospitals. Four cases involve so-called reason bans. Two cases related to parental notification and consent.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:55:53', ')', 'There are real reasons why the American public is concerned that you will overturn Roe or basically strip it of all meaning so that it becomes a nullity because you will have these ', 'cases that, as you say, the open question is how far the Supreme Court will go in letting states put limits on abortion. So that is why a lot of people are very concerned about your views as articulated pre-nomination, which convinced Senator Hawley you met his test. This morning, Senator Feinstein asked you a question about the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case in which the court recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and I was disappointed that you wouldn’t give a direct answer on whether you agreed with the majority in that case or if you instead agree with your mentor, Justice Scalia, that no such right exists in the Constitution.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:56:56', ')', 'Even though you didn’t give a direct answer, I think your response today speaks volumes. Not once, but twice, you used the term sexual preference to describe those in the LGBTQ community. And let me make clear, sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term. It is used by anti-LGBTQ activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice. It is not. Sexual orientation is a key part of a person’s identity. That sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable was a key part of the majority’s opinion in Obergefell, which by the way, Scalia did not agree with.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:57:45', ')', 'So if it is your view that sexual orientation is merely a preference, as you noted, then the LGBTQ community should be rightly concerned whether you would uphold their constitutional right to marry. I don’t think that you used the term sexual preference as just a … I don’t think it was an accident. And one of the legacies of Justice Scalia and his ', 'particular brand', ' of originalism is a resistance to recognizing those in the LGBTQ community as having equal rights under our Constitution. In 1996, Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in Romer v. Evans defending a state’s ability to openly discriminate against the LGBTQ community. In 2003, Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in Lawrence v. Texas defending a state’s right to criminally prosecute someone for same-sex sexual activity. Ten years later, in US v. Windsor, Justice Scalia wrote another dissenting opinion, this time defending the federal government’s right to deny federal recognition of same-sex marriages. And of course, two years after that, in Obergefell, Justice Scalia wrote yet another dissent, and this time, he argued that there was no constitutional right to same-sex marriage.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:59:02', ')', 'So under Justice Scalia’s judicial philosophy, what you have told us is your own, states could openly discriminate against the LGBTQ community, same-sex couples could be denied the right to get married, and they could actually be thrown in jail if they engaged in sexual intercourse. There are an estimated 11 million adults who identify as LGBTQ living in this country. Since Obergefell was decided in 2015, approximately 293,000 same-sex couples have gotten married. And many of these people are rightly afraid that if you are confirmed, you will join with other conservative members of the court to roll back ', 'everything the LGBTQ community has gained over the past two decades and push them back into the closet.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '01:59:52', ')', 'Now, two sitting justices are already calling for Obergefell to be narrowed, if not outright overturned. Just last week, Justices Thomas and Alito issued a statement concurring with the court’s decision to deny cert in Davis v. ', 'Ermold', ', a case involving a former Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples. They accused the court of, and this is Justices Alito and Thomas. They accused the court of, quote, reading a right to same-sex marriage into the 14th Amendment, even though that right is found nowhere in the text. And these two justices signal that Obergefell is a problem that only the court can fix.', 'Senator ', 'Hirono', ': (', '02:00:36', ')', 'So coupled with your use of the term sexual preference, coupled with your view on precedents, and that a justice’s view or her own analysis of the constitutionality should overtake or overcome precedents, if it’s in conflict. ', 'This is why', ' so many people in the LGBTQ community are so concerned that you would, in fact, join the signaling that these two justices have already put out there that Obergefell will fall by the wayside.

Judge Barrett, could you please give us an overview of the city ordinance that was challenged here and explain how precedent established by the Supreme Court’s Hill decision influenced your reasoning of the case?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:08:54', ')', 'Yes, I was on a panel. There was a challenge to a bubble zone ordinance, which essentially means … It was …. How to describe it? It limited where abortion protesters could go to do sidewalk counseling or leafleting or the things that they identified as the activities they desired to undertake and the expression of speech outside of the abortion clinic. The ', 'Supreme Court has a case called Hill v. Colorado, and that case said that such bubble zones, especially because this one in Chicago was nearly identical, as I recall, with the one that was at stake in Hill, said that they did not violate the First Amendment. And ', 'so', ' our panel, we’re bound by that precedent. Our panel applied that precedent. And so, as you say, that was a case involving abortion, but my duty as a judge was to follow the governing law, and that governing law in that case was Hill.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:09:52', ')', 'Absolutely, and thank you for that clarification. And I think it was important to point that out because in that case, using precedent, it did favor that abortion clinic. Is that correct?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:10:07', ')', 'That is correct.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:10:08', ')', 'Thank you very much. I would like to submit this for the record. Thank you.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:10:14', ')', 'Now turning to a topic of agency rulemaking, really sexy topic. Not something that we have talked about ', 'as of yet', '. But as I mentioned yesterday, when Congress makes laws that overstep the Constitution, it can be felt ', 'all across', ' the state of Iowa, whether it’s in the streets of Council Bluffs, Iowa, or in the farm fields over in Clinton County. But Congress isn’t the only body capable of overstep. Executive agencies can be just as guilty of this, as we’ve seen in Iowa. In 2018, as a judge on the Seventh Circuit, you helped decide a Clean Water Act case, specifically, Orchard Hill Building Company v. Army Corps of Engineers. The decision found that the federal government did not provide enough evidence to justify its decision to deem 13 acres of Illinois wetlands as a water of the US.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:11:19', ')', 'I’m very supportive of a less expansive definition of WOTUS and am encouraged by how you approached this decision. Farmers in Iowa are also encouraged by this development. I believed then as I do now that the Obama administration’s Clean Water Rule, or the WOTUS rule, was unconstitutional. But I also want to talk to you about agency rulemaking that I believe was constitutional, which is illustrated in a case that the 10th Circuit court has recently ruled on, specifically Renewable Fuels Association v. EPA. At issue in this case were three exemptions the EPA granted to oil companies allowing them to avoid their obligations to blend renewable fuel under the Clean Air Act’s Renewable Fuel Standard. These oil refinery exemptions, which were not disclosed to the public, were challenged by renewable fuel producers who said that they only found out about the waivers because of investigative news reports.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:12:28', ')', 'The 10th Circuit concluded in this case that the renewable fuels producers were injured by the EPA’s exemptions and thus had standing to sue. The court also found that the EPA ', 'exceeded its statutory authority in granting those petitions because the agency may only extend previously existing waivers. In the case of these three refiners, there was nothing to extend because they had let their exemptions lapse. In other words, the three refineries had not received continuously extended exemptions in the years preceding their petitions, as required by the statute.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:13:09', ')', 'However, in the wake of this 10th Circuit decision, small refineries flooded the EPA with 67 petitions for retroactive waivers, some dating back as far as 2011, in an attempt to go back in time and establish a chain of continuously extended exemptions. These oil companies have also appealed to the 10th Circuit decision, or the 10th Circuit decision to the Supreme Court.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:13:37', ')', 'While I’m not going to ask you to speak on all of this and what is going on, the problem here, bottom line, is that the EPA wasn’t following the law. They took the law that Congress passed. They twisted it and interpreted it for the benefit of oil producers, and that harmed our Iowa farmers. I know, again, you can’t speak on how you would rule on these cases, especially those that could be pending before the Supreme Court. But tell me, how do agencies … How should they interpret the laws that are passed by Congress?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:14:19', ')', 'I think that the court’s role in reviewing the lawfulness of agency action, it’s largely governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the way that agencies can do their business and outlines what their authority can be. There’s also a doctrine called Chevron, which is named after a case. And many times, if we’re talking about a Chevron issue, we’re talking about an issue of statutory interpretation. And it sounds like that’s mostly what you’re thinking of. And an agency, when a court reviews whether an agency has exceeded its lawful authority, it goes to the statute that you in Congress enact and interprets that statute, looks at the text, and tries to tell whether you’ve given the agency, given the EPA, in your example, leeway to adopt policies. And that leeway would be present if you had ambiguity in the statute that left the decision to the agency.', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:15:17', ')', 'But if the agency goes farther than the text of the statute permits, then it is the role of a court to say that that action was in conflict with the statute and therefore illegal.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:15:30', ')', 'And what happens, then, if there is an actual question on the intent of the law?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:15:38', ')', 'Well, a statute, in this context, in the context of a Chevron-type challenge to agencies, an agency’s interpretation of it, you would interpret the statute in the same way that you would interpret any other statute. ', 'So', ' as I was talking with Senator ', 'Sasse', ' about earlier, my ', 'own approach to it would be textualism. And ', 'so', ' in my approach to language, the intent of the statute is best expressed through the words, so looking at what the words would communicate to a skilled user of the language.', 'Joni Ernst: (', '02:16:09', ')', 'Very good. Well, I appreciate it. We do have a little bit of time remaining. Again, I just want to thank you. I want to thank your family very much for lending their support to you through this process. It can be a bit grueling. But I do have to say, though, your temperament throughout the entire hearing has been truly commendable, so thank you so much. I look forward to working with you further.

And I want to reiterate that one more time as cogently as I can because this is something like we’ve just never seen before in the history of the United States. We’re not just days away from Election Day, but people are ', 'actually voting', ' right now. Close to a million people in my state have already voted, and about 10 million people voted nationally. The only other time a Supreme Court nomination hearing happened this close to an election was, as you probably know, is under President Lincoln, who declined to offer a nomination before the election.', 'Cory Booker: (', '02:17:33', ')', 'But we are in the midst of an ongoing election right now at a very contentious time in our democracy. It’s probably not normal also because people are already speaking in this election, and it seems like we are rushing through this process. When many of my colleagues on this committee said just four years ago that we should not proceed to fill a vacancy that opened 269 days before an election. In the words of some of my colleagues, ', 'including the chairman, was to use our words against us. We would not do exactly what we’re doing right now.', 'Cory Booker: (', '02:18:07', ')', 'It’s also not normal, clearly, because we’re in the middle of a pandemic, and we have tens of thousands of new COVID infections every single day. Widespread food insecurity like we haven’t seen these kind of food lines in my lifetime, I don’t think. People across our country are struggling. And unfortunately, we see that we are, right now, not dealing with this crisis. We are, instead, literally having closed the Senate virtually, and the only proceedings that are being allowed to go forward are not the issues of helping people who are ', 'struggling, but', ' dealing with this.', 'Cory Booker: (', '02:18:42', ')', 'And it’s not normal that we have a president who has repeatedly attacked the legitimacy of our institutions. So much so, and I’ve never seen something like this in my lifetime, that his former cabinet members, his former chief of staff, all talked about the danger he represents to the country we all love. In fact, probably one of the most respected person on both sides of the aisle, General Mattis, who served as our Secretary of Defense, went as far as to say, a man who has been very reserved in his comments, that Donald Trump is a danger to our democracy.', 'Cory Booker: (', '02:19:16', ')', 'We are at a time that the legitimacy of our institutions are at stake, and it’s not normal that the president would further cast a shadow over your nomination, as well as the independence of the court by saying he would only nominate justices who would tear down Roe v. Wade, who would overturn ACA. And it’s not normal, amidst this all, and again, something that I find hard to believe that we’re talking about is that we have a president who cannot commit himself to the peaceful transfer of power. Now, in the light of this abnormality, most Americans think we should wait on your nomination. It’s an illegitimate process. Most Americans think that we should wait. Today, and I appreciate you not following the news, but 90 of your fellow faculty members from Notre Dame wrote an open letter.', 'Cory Booker: (', '02:20:03', ')', '… Fellow faculty members from Notre Dame wrote an open letter calling on you for the sake of our democracy.

Is there a difference and what is it?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:42:00', ')', 'Senator, I really in using that word did not mean to imply that I think that it’s not an immutable characteristic or that it’s solely a matter of preference.

And Judge Barrett, well, I’ll get to some new material, but a lot of what I do at the beginning, we’ll be going over things you’ve already said and you must think you had to say way too many times. I’m going to just be sure that we get some things nailed down once more. Before I do that, though, there’s been a lot said today that really needs to be responded to. This won’t be a question to you. These first two, I’m just going to quickly respond to a couple of them. The first was one of my colleagues, Senator Whitehouse spent a very long presentation trying to make the case that there is a lot of dark money out there trying to control the Supreme Court nominations and this whole process and the situation that we face today.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:49:56', ')', 'I just want to set the record straight. These are ', 'actually some', ' statistics that Senator Cruz quickly went through when he spoke. But yeah, there is dark money in ', 'politics', ' and I think ', 'that we should get it out. What this means is that money that where you don’t know who the real donors are behind the entity that’s making the expenditures. Fortunately, we’re getting a lot of that out, but there’s still a lot there. The impression though that was left was that this dark money is all on one side. The reality is if you look at it, opensecrets.org, this data is from 2016, but I’ve seen that even later into 2018, and it’s the same kind of statistics.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:50:34', ')', 'And that is that really the significant majority of the dark money is being spent in favor of the democratic side, rather than the Republican side. Of the top 20 organizations and individuals that they identified who contribute to super PACS, who then utilize the money in the way that was talked about, 14 of them give exclusively to Democrats. Of the top 10 on that list, only to give to Republicans. And the totals, by the way, were $422 million in this report going to Democrats and $189 million going to Republicans.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:51:11', ')', 'So yeah, there is money in the system, which we can’t identify. A lot of this money by the way is going into ads against you, Judge Barrett but we can’t get it all out yet. I think we ought to get it out, but let’s not try to create the impression that this is just some one-sided circumstance that’s happening in the country. The other thing I want to go over first before I got into my questions is the same thing I went over yesterday. Because the allegations have been made again and again and again, that somehow we are rushing this case and somehow we are violating the history and the precedent of the way the Senate operates and the way the presidency operates when there is a vacancy in an election year.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:51:54', ')', 'Some people count these things differently. There’s a statistic that I will use that will count all vacancies that have happened, whether the vacancy occurred in the election year or whether it just didn’t get resolved until the election year, but it doesn’t matter whether you just take the ones that arose in the election year, or if you take all of them that were resolved in the election year, the precedent is the same. It’s overwhelming.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:52:19', ')', 'In every single case, the sitting president made a nomination, every case. In those ', 'cases', ' in which the Senate was of the same party as the president, I’m going to use the one for all of the nominations that actually were dealt with in an election year, there were 29. 19 of them were when the party was the same as the president. 17 of those 19, the party moved ahead with the president’s nomination and the nomination was confirmed. 10 of those times, it was when the party was not the party of the president. In nine of those cases, the party that was not the party of the president declined to move forward until the next president was elected. Now that’s the precedent of the Senate. That’s what happened in 2016 when the Senate was of a different party than the president. And it’s what’s ', 'happening now when the Senate is the party of the president, and those are the facts, and that’s the precedent.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:53:24', ')', 'In terms of the timing, I went through the timing then as well. I think you’re hearing started Judge Barrett on the 16th day from the day you were nominated. There’s a bunch of members of the Supreme Court whose nomination hearings started sooner than that, including Ruth Ginsburg, Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And ', 'so', ' the fact is that normal procedures, appropriate timing and appropriate policy and precedent is being followed here as we move forward.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:53:53', ')', 'Now having made those points once again, like I said, I will get into some new questions for you. But I’m going to go over a lot of things that you’ve already talked about because I really think it’s important that we just make it as clear as possible. You’ve talked about originalism and textualism. Is there a difference between those two things?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:54:14', ')', 'They are the same basic approach, but we use originalism mostly to refer to interpreting the constitutional text and textualism we use to refer to interpreting statutory text. But they both involve the same principle, which is that one comes to the law and interprets it as it would have been understood by those at the time of its either its ratification in the case of the constitution or its enactment in the case of a statute. And that the law remains the law until it’s lawfully changed through democratic processes.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:54:48', ')', 'All right. Thank you. And I assume you would consider yourself both an originalist and a textual?', 'Amy Coney Barrett: (', '02:54:51', ')', 'I do Senator Crapo.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:54:53', ')', 'And you’ve written quite a bit about precedent and stare decisis. Could you just once again tell us what that is and maybe you could make a distinction between what-', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:55:03', ')', '… And maybe you could make a distinction between what it means at the appellate level and at the Supreme Court level.', 'Amy: (', '02:55:07', ')', 'Sure. ', 'So', ' there are two kinds of stare decisis. There’s horizontal stare decisis, which is say the Supreme Court’s obligation to follow its own precedent. And then there’s vertical stare decisis, which is my obligation right now on the seventh circuit to follow a Supreme Court precedent because it sits above me in the federal judicial hierarchy. For vertical precedent, ', 'there’s no question. I can’t buck what the Supreme court does. It sets the precedent and all lower courts must follow it. For horizontal precedent, for example, on my own court right now in the seventh circuit, the court that renders a precedent does have the ability to reconsider it under certain circumstances. Otherwise errors don’t get fixed and Plessy versus Ferguson would still be the law of the land.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:55:56', ')', 'And you will, I’m sure, tell me, what are those… What are the rules there when you do horizontal re-evaluation?', 'Amy: (', '02:56:02', ')', 'Sure. ', 'So', ' when a court decides whether or not to overrule a precedent, it considers first of all, is it wrong? And how egregiously wrong is it? That we can see in the Brown vs Board of Education decision, how that factor played. You also consider reliance interests, because as I said before, stare decisis is short for stand by the thing decided, and don’t disturb the calm. ', 'So', ' courts don’t recklessly get in the business of just stirring up, disrupting people’s lives unless it’s the other factors, council, in favor of doing it. You consider whether the law has developed since the precedent in a way that undercuts the foundations of the precedent itself. Same for the facts. You also consider whether the precedent that you set has proved to be workable for the courts below you that must follow it. ', 'So', ' in my case, on the seventh circuit, that would mean the district courts have we set out an articulation of the law and a case that lower courts can actually use.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:57:08', ')', 'And so if I, to paraphrase here, if a judge in a horizontal situation, either a Supreme Court justice evaluating Supreme Court precedent, or a Circuit Court judge evaluating the Circuit Courts precedent, if they felt the precedent was wrong, that’s not enough.', 'Amy: (', '02:57:27', ')', 'That is not enough.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:57:29', ')', 'And you have to have then the reliance and the other factors all falling into the right circumstance before a decision to actually overrule or overturn a precedent is made.', 'Amy: (', '02:57:41', ')', 'That’s true. And this might be a good time, Senator Crapo, for me to make one other point about horizontal stare decisis doctrine. Earlier, and I can’t remember which interchange it was, someone was pointing out, that I said, stare decisis should have weaker effect in constitutional cases. That’s ', 'actually what', ' the Supreme Court has said. That’s a well-established principle of stare decisis doctrine itself. The court has said that it gives super strong effect to precedent in statutory cases because you all can always step in and fix any errors of statutory interpretation the court might make. But the court itself has expressly said that it gives weaker stare decisis effect in constitutional cases, because the only way ', 'to remedy an error is by constitutional amendment. ', 'So', ' I just want to be clear that that is simply a restatement of the court’s own doctrine, that wasn’t something I invented.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:58:36', ')', 'All right, I appreciate that. And you also mentioned earlier that there are some, I think you said six super precedents?', 'Amy: (', '02:58:43', ')', 'Let’s see. I can’t remember how many are on the list, but as I said, it’s in constitutional law scholarship, there are some precedents that scholars have identified as utterly beyond question that no serious person ever calls for their overruling.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:58:58', ')', 'Could you… I think Brown versus Board of Education would be one of those.', 'Amy: (', '02:59:02', ')', 'Marbury versus Madison, which establishes the power of judicial review. Let’s see, the cases… It probably easier for me to just identify what the precedent stand for. So the power of judicial review, the power of the Supreme Court to refute judgments from state courts, the proposition that the 14th amendment applies only to state action, the incorporation of the fourth amendment, and by implication, the other rights in the Bill of Rights against the States. ', 'So', ' they’re mostly structural foundational principles and they’re just so settled no one seriously challenges anymore.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '02:59:43', ')', 'All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. I think that’s very helpful. And in this ', 'hearing', ' you’ve been asked about at least three very significant Supreme Court precedents. And you’ve been asked whether you were asked to commit to overturn them, or whether you even had conversations with the president or his staff about them one. And I just want you to, again, give your answer on that because I want this to be very clear. Roe V wade, have you had any conversations with the president or with the white house staff, white house counsel, anyone, and have you made any commitments about how you would rule on any case dealing with that?', 'Amy: (', '03:00:24', ')', 'I have not Senator Crapo.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:00:26', ')', 'Thank you. And the same set of questions ', 'with regard to', ' Obergefell?', 'Amy: (', '03:00:31', ')', 'I’ve had no conversations with anyone in the white house staff about that case, my views of it, how I would rule.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:00:37', ')', 'All right. And then finally, the current case, California V. Texas?', 'Amy: (', '03:00:43', ')', 'No conversations at all.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:00:45', ')', 'All right. Thank you. Now, you also earlier testified that there’s a difference between judicial decision making and the process of making a judicial decision, versus say the process you would as a professor when writing an article or what have you. Could you just quickly get into that with me?', 'Amy: (', '03:01:02', ')', 'Sure. So a professor when writing law review articles or doing academic critique is kind of at a 10,000 foot level, you’re not in the trenches like a judge is because you are not deciding it in the context of a real case with real litigants in front of you, the adversarial process, where you have people on either side where you hear arguments and you consult with your colleagues and you write your opinion.', 'Amy: (', '03:01:26', ')', 'And I think one thing that’s worth pointing out about the judicial process is that I have had the experience of changing my mind at various points along the way. I’ve gone into oral argument more than once thinking I was going to rule one way, and then oral arguments changed my mind. Or I’ve gone into conference and my colleagues have changed my mind. I’ve even changed my mind, and this is not uncommon on the court, once I started writing an opinion, judges say it won’t right. Which means what you thought was right when you started writing it, you realize ', 'actually didn’t', ' really work out. ', 'So', ' I think that process and the fact that judges keep an open mind all the way through is evidence of how the judicial process really is unique in our system, and it is a different enterprise than academic critique.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:02:14', ')', 'Thank you. I’ve been able to observe that a little bit. I clerked on the ninth circuit court of the three.', 'Amy: (', '03:02:18', ')', 'That’s right, you told me that.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:02:20', ')', 'And so I’ve been able to observe that exact process in each of those steps that you talked about taking place and you’re right. That’s how it happens when it’s done properly. Next, I want to go to one more specific process type thing to make sure we all understand it right, and that’s the recusal. Interestingly, you’ve been asked by my colleagues on the other side to assure that you have made no commitments about case law, but that to give a ', 'commitment on recusal, you have said that there is a process for recusal as well, and that you would follow that. Could you please lay that out again once again for us?', 'Amy: (', '03:02:58', ')', 'Yes. Recusal is a question of law because 28USC, 455, the recusal statute, ', 'actually obligates', ' a judge to recuse in certain cases of either actual bias or apparent bias. And there are Supreme Court precedents interpreting the range of a ', 'judges', ' obligations under that statute. There are also professional conduct committees to consult, and I think collaboration and consultation, as I’ve said before, with other justices is the typical practice, according to Justice Ginsburg’s description of it. ', 'So', ' it is a legal question that’s governed by statute and precedent. ', 'So', ' it’s not one that I can make an advanced resolution of.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:03:37', ')', 'All right, thank you. Now I want to move to, frankly, back to California V Texas and the pre-existing conditions issue that has been raised by ', 'a number of', ' my colleagues here. We’ve heard lot about the Affordable Care Act yesterday and today. I serve on the finance committee as well as the judiciary committee, and so this is an issue I really care about a lot. I’m passionate about ensuring that all individuals, especially Idahoans, have affordable quality healthcare coverage, and making sure that they have coverage for their pre-existing conditions is especially important, regardless of what one thinks about the Obamacare legislation. Reasonable people can disagree about the totality of the success of Obamacare, and this is something that I think should be remembered, but many of the policies in Obamacare were policies that on which we had agreement between Republicans and Democrats, as we moved forward at that time, trying to craft a healthcare law. People may recall this was being negotiated in the finance committee for a quite a while before President Obama pulled it back and then brought his own statute out.', 'Senator Mike Crapo: (', '03:04:52', ')', 'And one of the things that we had agreement on was protecting pre-existing conditions back then, there was no fight over that. And in fact, I think every single US Senator wants to protect access to coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions, Republicans and Democrats. So here we are now talking about the Obamacare legislation that was pushed through the Senate when there was a Senate and a president of the same party and the ability to avoid a filibuster. And we’re now looking at legislation challenging one part of that. Again, you’ve talked about this, but I’d like you to just to set up this next question, there’s a difference between NFIB versus Sebelius, the case which you have made some commentary on, and Texas V California. Could you tell me the difference?', 'Amy: (', '03:05:46', ')', 'Yes. NFIB versus Sebelius involved whether the mandate violated the con… It was framed initially as a case about whether the mandate violated the commerce clause and the majority in that case, as I’ve discussed in earlier interchanges, interpreted the mandate ', 'provision to be a tax rather than a penalty. And Chief Justice Roberts said that he thought it was justified as an exercise of Congress’s taxing ', 'power, but', ' would have been invalid under the commerce clause.', 'Amy: (', '03:06:17', ')', 'Now, the new case that the Supreme Court is poised to hear involves a different question. If the mandate, which has now been zeroed out, the initial question does resemble NFIB versus Sebelius because the initial question is, is something a tax if it’s $0? ', 'So', ' is it still a tax? And if it’s not a tax, can it be justified under Congress’s taxing power? But severability, even assuming that it is no longer a tax because it’s zeroed out, the next question is if that provision is unconstitutional, does just that provision become inactive, so to speak, or does the whole statute fall?

Two years later, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court recognized that the fundamental right to marry could not be denied to LGBT Americans. Both decisions were decided by a five to four margin. Justice Ginsburg was in the majority. Justice Scalia dissented in both cases.', 'Senator Dianne Feinstein: (', '03:40:55', ')', 'Now, you said in your acceptance speech for this nomination, that Justice Scalia’s philosophy is your philosophy.

So I don’t think that anybody should assume that just because Justice Scalia decided a decision a certain way, that I would too, but I’m not going to express a view on whether I agree or disagree with Justice Scalia, for the same reasons that I’ve been giving. Justice Ginsburg, with her characteristic pithiness, used this to describe how a nominee should comport herself at a hearing: “No hints, no previews, no forecasts.” That had been the practice of nominees before her, but everybody calls it the Ginsburg Rule because she stated it so concisely, and it’s been the practice of every nominee since.

I understand you don’t want to answer these questions directly, but you identify yourself with a justice that, you, like him, would be a consistent vote to roll back hard-fought freedoms and protections for the LGBT community.

Before I begin, I wanted to take a moment to talk directly with the American people about where we are, and how we got here. ', 'So', ' we are in the middle of a deadly pandemic that has hit our country harder than any other country in the world. More than 215,000 of our fellow Americans have died, and millions more, including the President, Republican members of this committee, and more than 100 front line workers here at the Capitol Complex have been infected. This pandemic has led to an historic economic crisis, causing millions of workers to lose their jobs without warning, and 12 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:46:03', ')', 'The Senate, I strongly believe, must be and needs to be laser-focused on you, the American people, and help you get through this pandemic. To do so, the Senate urgently needs to pass critical financial relief for those who are struggling because of this pandemic, and many are struggling. People need help. They need help to pay their rent or mortgage. Parents need help putting food on the table. The millions of American workers who have lost their jobs need help making it through the end of the month, and small businesses need ', 'help', ' so they don’t have to close their doors for good. But sadly, Senate Republicans have rushed to hold this Supreme Court confirmation hearing, rather than help those who are suffering through a public health crisis not of their making. As I said yesterday, these priorities are not the American people’s priorities.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:47:11', ')', 'Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Senate Republicans’ number one priority has been to tear it down. And remember, before the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies held virtually unchecked power over our healthcare system. They could refuse to cover basic medical expenses like maternity care, like mammograms, like prescription drugs, or hospital stays. Worst of all, if you were sick, they could deny you coverage altogether, and there was nothing you could do about it. Over the last nine years, Republicans in Congress have tried 70 times, 70 times, to repeal or roll back the ACA in the United States Congress. In 2013, Senate Republicans were so desperate to stop its success that they shut down the entire government for weeks.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:48:11', ')', 'After President Trump was elected, Washington Republicans spent nearly a year trying to repeal the ACA, but I will always remember the thousands of Americans from all over our country in all walks of life, who crowded into the halls of the United States Capitol to require that lawmakers see their faces and understand how they would be hurt, if there was a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Brave activists in the disability community staged sit-ins on the Hill. Seniors protested to keep prescription drugs affordable. Mothers and fathers walked the halls with their children and strollers, to show Congress the face of those who depended on the law, and doctors and nurses protested to protect their patients’ access to the care they desperately need.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:49:11', ')', 'Together, with many of my colleagues, I joined civil rights and community leaders to speak to the thousands of people who gathered outside the Capitol, as they pleaded, as they begged with lawmakers to do the right thing. ', 'All of', ' these dedicated Americans demanding that their voices be heard, and they made a difference. They made a difference. History will remember that late night, thumbs down movement when the great, great John McCain denied Republicans the opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And now, following a decade of failure, Washington Republicans have realized that the Affordable Care Act is ', 'working too well and helping too many people, to repeal it without facing serious political consequences.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:50:09', ')', 'But what are they doing? After suffering the ', 'backlash', ' they provoked by targeting the law in Congress, they decided instead to circumvent voters, and try to strike down the Affordable Care Act through the courts. Right now, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are urging the Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act and ', 'all of', ' its patient protections. Republicans are scrambling to confirm this nominee as fast as possible, because they need one more Trump judge on the bench before November 10th, to win and strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. This is not hyperbole. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening. And here’s what you ', 'have to', ' know. People are scared. People ', 'are scared of', ' what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic. There are more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma, and diabetes, heart disease, who know that they could be denied coverage, are charged more by insurance companies, if Donald Trump is successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And because of the coronavirus, more than seven million people have now a pre-existing condition that they didn’t have earlier this year. Those who depend on the ACA are afraid of their lives being turned upside down, if the court strikes it down. They know what could happen.', 'Senator Kamala Harris: (', '03:51:51', ')', 'And Judge Barrett, I will share with you and the American people, a list. No protections for pre-existing conditions, higher costs for healthcare for women, and people over the age of 50. Young adults kicked off their parents’ insurance, more expensive prescription drugs for seniors, insurance companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity care. No free mammograms, cancer screenings, or birth control. Insurance companies reinstating annual and lifetime caps, and more than 20 million Americans losing insurance at the worst possible time, again, ', 'in the midst of', ' a pandemic, including nearly two million Texans, 607,000 North Carolinians, 288,000 South Carolinians, 227,000 Iowans, and 4.2 million Californians. And the pain of losing these protections would disproportionately be felt among the nine million African American, Latino, Asian, and Native Americans who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Our colleagues across the aisle have spent a lot of time talking about COVID relief and the importance of that for healthcare and for people that are suffering. They have the opportunity. We can put our bill back on the floor.

I think that from some of the comments from some of our colleagues, there has been confusion about that. The next thing is Senator Whitehouse kind of came at you saying you had never tried a case. And I think it is important to note that Justice Kagan had never tried a case. And we want to have that she’s been mentioned several times today. So as a point of clarification, we would want to mention this. One thing that we have heard a good bit about at this committee and some of our colleagues chose to mention this yesterday is that Republicans don’t nominate enough female judges.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:49:48', ')', 'But when we nominate a highly qualified woman for a Supreme Court vacancy, what is the very first thing they do? They turn their attack machine on and then they start into the politics of personal destruction and they attack you for not fitting into the paradigm of the left because you’re pro-life, pro-family pro religion. And we have seen this happen with other judges that have come before us. Judge Naomi Rao, Wendy Vitter, they have been criticized. And if you don’t buy into this agenda of the left, if you’re female, then they act as if you’re not a real woman.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:50:46', ')', 'And I will tell you, quite frankly, they do not believe that all women deserve to have the opportunity to have a seat at the table. It’s only certain women and we have seen their liberal narrative play out today. Senator ', 'Hirono', ' really tuned up on this when she suggested that you of all people would not support women in the workplace. And I will tell you this as a woman who has worked in the private sector and then in public service. When comments like that are made, it discourages all women from trying to step forward and trying to take the skills that they have developed in one area of their life and then use it as an opportunity to serve their nation, to serve their community because they don’t want the liberal attack machine pointed at them.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:51:55', ')', 'And I will tell you, quite frankly, it is so discouraging to me to see groups on the left say, we want diversity. But let that diversity come from a woman who is on the political right, and it’s like their heads explode. They do not want that as a part of the conversation. What they prefer to have is that very narrow, liberal viewpoint. And I look forward to the day when that will stop because all women deserve the opportunity to rise. I find it so interesting that they don’t want to say support women from the political right because we do not submit to the leftist agenda.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:52:56', ')', 'We won’t submit to that. So then free thinkers end up being called bad women and traders to our gender and other disparaging comments that are out there. And you have endured some of these pretty extraordinary revelations today. Many of which have involved accusations that ', 'you’re', ' part of some sort of back room conspiracy to rig the system against the American people and that your record as a judge is somehow frightening and it is going to cause a panic. But I have a feeling that this isn’t the first time you have heard such rhetoric or been subjected to such rhetoric by a group of your peers that have probably tried to hold you back because of your personal beliefs.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:53:55', ')', 'I think that most of us that come from the political spectrum on the right have endured that. A professional organization that would have been nice to join, but because ', 'you’re', ' ', 'pro life', ', you can’t. Opinion not wanted, participation not wanted because ', 'you’re', ' pro religion, ', 'pro family', '. Opinion not wanted. Do not apply for admission. And this is the kind of wrong-headed perceptions that need to stop. It is not uncommon for women who practice their faith or who hold pro-life views to endure this, especially in a professional context. And that is what we have seen the left throw at you today.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:54:49', ')', 'And I find it so interesting that they have tried to use this focus to evaluate your professionalism as a judge, doing to you exactly what they say they despise. Interesting take. I’d like to hear it a little bit more about the intellectual and personal discipline you ', 'mentioned during Senator Lee’s line of questioning. Let’s go back to that. You said that discipline is required for resisting the urge to exercise your own will when deciding how to rule on a case. ', 'So', ' talk for just a second about that, why it’s important to stay true to your basic constitutional statutory framework rather than favoring the living constitution approach.', 'Amy: (', '04:55:49', ')', 'Well, Senator Blackburn, I think as I came up with Senator Lee and I know as Senator ', 'Sasse', ' and Senator Hawley too, that judges are not policymakers. And we live in a pluralistic society where we have lots of different views on lots of different matters as Senator Kennedy was pointing out. And ', 'so', ' in a pluralistic society, I may approach a particular problem, let’s say it’s a problem of constitutional law, and I may really feel like the result I want is one way, but I’m just one person. And there are surely other people in America, other people on the bench who would see the best resolution going a different way.', 'Amy: (', '04:56:34', ')', 'So who am I, or who is any judge, to say that their result like just this once or just this time, I’m going to reach the result that seems the best, even if it runs against the law that the people have ratified. And ', 'so', ' it would be wrong because, I mean, I don’t think people, I think I said earlier, want to live under the law of Amy. I mean, we have the United States Constitution and that’s what judges should be faithful to. I see Senator Kennedy [inaudible 04:57:02].', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:57:02', ')', 'But I think probably the law of Amy prevails at the Barrett household over those children.', 'Amy: (', '04:57:10', ')', '50/50.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:57:12', ')', 'I used to tell my children and my son’s birthday is today and we were chatting earlier and we were laughing about how when I wanted them to do something that they didn’t necessarily want to do, I would remind them that I was the chief mama in charge. And ', 'so', ' it was something that was going to happen. Let me touch just a second on Obamacare because they have, our friends across the aisle have seemed to express just a deep concern about a case that is coming up on November 10th, the severability clause and how this would take Obamacare down.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:57:55', ')', 'Again, this goes into their fear-mongering and causing panic, and we know that. Because it’s not about the ACA case that is scheduled for November 10th, this is all about they’re concerned that a constitutionalist judge on the Supreme Court just might get in the way of their push to implement government-run healthcare, to do a socialized medicine plan or to ', 'do the green new deal or to do statehood for DC, their ', 'wishlist', ' of items that they have. But we do for the record need to clean up the numbers that are around this.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:58:40', ')', 'We’ve heard some wild numbers get thrown around today when it comes to the ACA. There are right now 8.3 million Americans enrolled in the ACA marketplace exchange, enrolled in Obamacare. And what they’re doing is blowing that number up and they have tacked on the entire individual market and added Medicaid and Medicare to get to their number that they are saying is 150 million Americans are going to lose their healthcare. What they’re not saying is there are 153 million Americans that are in the private health care marketplace. ', 'So', ' if they got their way, every one of those individuals in that private healthcare marketplace would lose their health insurance.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '04:59:50', ')', 'So our goal is to make certain that all Americans have access to affordable healthcare. And I think it’s a bit disingenuous the way that 8.3 million is the number that comes to us from CMS and HHS. And then as I said, they’re blowing that up by adding in the entire individual market and Medicaid and Medicare and forgetting to mention that there are 153 Americans that have a private health insurance. My colleague from California would really like to have people believe that your sole mission in life is to overturn the ACA, and you have stated that you are not on a mission to overturn the ACA.', 'Amy: (', '05:00:55', ')', 'I am not, Senator Blackburn, and I have no mission and no agenda. Judges don’t have campaign promises.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:01:02', ')', 'That’s a good thing. And they’ve made much about a letter that you signed opposing a contraceptive mandate and an article that you wrote criticizing an interpretation of the ACA as attacks. But I had a very interesting conversation today. I ', 'actually did', ' a Facebook Live with one of your former students who had written an op-ed for Real Clear Politics. Chase?', 'Amy: (', '05:01:33', ')', 'Mm-hmm (affirmative).', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:01:34', ')', 'And Chase Giacomo said, one of the things he appreciated about you is that you made your students think. And I think that is a wonderful trait for a judge because what you did was to cause them to get into problem solving. And at a time when we live in a cancel culture, that is a very positive thing to have students do, to cause them to think. ', 'So', ' we really appreciate that and I know that you’ve stated that you’re going to put aside personal opinions and abide by the constitution when it comes to addressing all of the cases that would come before you. Let’s move on. Senator ', 'Sasse', ' went to the fourth amendment with ', 'you, and I want to touch on this pertaining to electronic searches and surveillance. And the fourth amendment is so important for safeguarding the privacy of our citizens and our data from unreasonable searches and seizures. And so many Americans are doing so much of their life online. And I think it is imperative that Americans ', 'have the ability to', ' protect their virtual you, which is their presence online, their data, their transactional life. And now for so many people, it is the way they’re working.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:03:25', ')', 'And as you said at the White House ceremony, the Barrett E- Academy of which you all co-principals, people are going to school online. And there was a case Carpenter vs US and outlined just how far the constitution protects searches of electronic evidence. It was a five, four decision and the court ruled that law enforcement must obtain a warrant in order to track a person cellular location information beyond seven days. Justice Thomas and Gorsuch both dissented and Justice Gorsuch objected that the majority’s reasonable expectation of privacy standard was not faithful to the fourth amendment text.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:04:20', ')', 'Instead, Justice Gorsuch reasoned the fourth amendment protects only those searches included in the original text, searches of persons houses, places, and affects. Some critics of originalism complained that today’s laws should not be governed by the dead hand of the past. Can you explain to us how the fourth amendment can still govern the modern worlds searches and seizures and how will it continue? How will it continue to apply to emerging technologies that the founders never could have imagined?', 'Amy: (', '05:05:03', ')', 'Sure. So I think as a general matter, the fourth amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and it doesn’t mean that it protects only the kinds of searches and seizures that those who lived at the time of the adoption of the bill of rights could have anticipated. So ', 'surely', ' they couldn’t have anticipated the internet or cell phones or airplanes for that matter. But one can reason from the kinds of privacy protections that were in place in 1791 when the fourth amendment was ratified to see if the search of modern technology now is analogous to it.', 'Amy: (', '05:05:44', ')', 'So one example is the ', 'Kylo', ' case, Justice Scalia wrote that opinion and that’s a case where law enforcement had used an infrared detector to see if someone was growing, I think it was, marijuana on the inside and they could use the infrared to see if it lit up if people were using heat lights, essentially inside. And Justice Scalia said that, yes, that was a search, that the fourth amendment did ', 'apply', ' and the police had to have a warrant. Even though that technology didn’t exist at the time, it was the same kind of invasion into the home.', 'Amy: (', '05:06:16', ')', 'And so it didn’t matter that infrared machines were not in the contemplation of the generation that ratified the fourth amendment.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:06:24', ')', 'Okay. And then is there a difference between searching for data via a device that is in a person’s possession and searching for, say, data on the servers that are hosting?', 'Amy: (', '05:06:46', ')', 'Let’s see. So that would be a question I probably can’t answer. In addition to the fourth amendment, there would also be statutes that govern how much data one could mine. So that would be one of those legal hypothetical situations that I wouldn’t be able to answer in the context of the hearing.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:07:05', ')', 'All right. Let’s end it at that so that you can get out of here. There are a couple of things that tomorrow we’re going to have time and we will talk about a couple of those other questions, campus free speech, executive overreach, a couple of other things we’d like to have on the record. But thank you very much for your patience and for your desire to serve.', 'Amy: (', '05:07:34', ')', 'Thank you, Senator Blackburn.', 'Senator Blackburn: (', '05:07:34', ')', 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman.', 'Senator Graham: (', '05:07:35', ')', 'Thanks, Senator Blackburn.

To the committee, I quite frankly think this has been good example of what can be in the judiciary committee.
